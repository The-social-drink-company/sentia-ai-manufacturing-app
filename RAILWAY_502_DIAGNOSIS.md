# Railway 502 Bad Gateway Diagnosis

## Current Status

- **Local Development**: ✅ Working perfectly on localhost:5000
- **Railway Deployment**: ❌ 502 Bad Gateway

## From Railway Logs Analysis

### What's Working:

1. Application starts successfully
2. Database connects: `postgresql://sentia_dev:...`
3. WebSocket connects to MCP Server
4. Auto-sync schedules initialized
5. Logging system operational

### Likely Causes of 502:

1. **Server Not Completing Startup**
   - The server may be crashing after initial setup
   - Missing the success log: `[SUCCESS] Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:${port}`

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - NODE_ENV might be causing issues
   - Port binding may be incorrect

3. **Database Connection Failure**
   - Despite showing "configured", actual queries may be failing
   - The dummy credentials in .env are being overridden by Railway

## Immediate Fix Actions

### 1. Check Railway Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Railway dashboard:

```
PORT=5000 (or let Railway auto-assign)
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=(should be auto-set by Railway)
```

### 2. Add Health Check Timeout

Railway may be timing out the health check. Add to server.js:

```javascript
// Add before httpServer.listen
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('CapLiquify Manufacturing Platform API Server')
})
```

### 3. Add Startup Logging

The server should show:

```
[CRITICAL] Starting server on 0.0.0.0:5000
[SUCCESS] Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

If the [SUCCESS] line is missing, the server isn't fully starting.

### 4. Check Railway Service Settings

In Railway dashboard:

- Ensure "Start Command" is: `npm start` or `node server.js`
- Check "Health Check Path": Should be `/api/health`
- Verify "Port": Should be 5000 or ${{PORT}}

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check if server is actually running on Railway
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.up.railway.app/

# Check API health endpoint
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.up.railway.app/api/health

# Check basic route
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.up.railway.app/api/dashboard/overview
```

## Root Cause

Based on the logs, the server is starting but not completing its initialization. The 502 error indicates Railway's proxy cannot reach the application, which means:

1. The server crashed after initial startup
2. The server is not binding to the correct port
3. A critical error is preventing the listen() call from completing

## Recommended Solution

1. Check Railway logs for any error after "WebSocket Monitor Status"
2. Ensure PORT environment variable is properly set
3. Add more verbose logging around the listen() call
4. Consider adding a simple root route handler for Railway's health checks
