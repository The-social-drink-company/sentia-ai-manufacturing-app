# Daily Log - BMAD Method

## 2025-10-20
- Completed **BMAD-DEV-001** to restore development bypass defaults and unblock dashboard access without Clerk credentials.
- Added `useAIMetrics` hook with deterministic fallback data; AI Insights panel now renders offline.
- Realigned `FinancialAlgorithms` service with `/financial/*` API responses and labelled development-only fallbacks to respect the "no mock" contract.
- Updated BMAD update queue to flag the AI Insights and financial service gaps as resolved.
- Noted missing pnpm executable locally; relied on `npx eslint` for targeted lint checks (ignored files warning only).
- Completed **BMAD-DEV-002** by enriching `/api/ai/insights` with structured insight objects and summary metadata, matching the frontend schema while flagging development fallbacks.
