# BMAD Status Review - 2025-10-20

## Background
- Audit triggered by repeated requests to continue BMAD-method execution and verify real delivery status.
- Prior documentation (bmad/tracking/workflow-status.md) reports EPIC-002 through EPIC-005 as complete or ready, but multiple implementation gaps were suspected.

## Mission
- Confirm what functionality actually exists in the repository.
- Record divergence between documentation and code reality for admin portal and working capital upgrades.
- Surface blockers preventing BMAD roadmap execution (lint, tests, workflow hygiene).

## Actions and Findings
- **Working Capital Services**: server/services/finance now contains six modules (CashConversionCycle.js, CashRunway.js, InventoryOptimization.js, ScenarioModeler.js, ApprovalEngine.js, MitigationPlanner.js). API endpoints were wired in server/api/working-capital.js, but they depend on Prisma models (adminApproval, working capital records, queue monitors) that are not defined in the repo.
- **Frontend Integration**: src/features/working-capital/components includes ScenarioPlanner.jsx, ApprovalInsights.jsx, MitigationPlan.jsx, but no automated tests cover these flows. React Query hook useWorkingCapitalOptimization.js assumes new endpoints are reachable.
- **Admin Portal Backend**: server/routes/admin/index.js exposes numerous routes, yet most controllers (dashboardController.js, usersController.js, systemHealthController.js, etc.) still return 501 placeholders. Middleware adminMfa.js trusts headers/session flags and lacks OTP verification; adminAudit.js only logs to stdout, no persistence layer.
- **Testing Health**: `npx vitest --run` currently fails (7 suites failing, 41 tests failing). QueueMonitorService tests expect legacy ordering fields (createdAt) and mock helpers not aligned with code changes. New admin service test suites in tests/unit/services/admin do not compile due to syntax errors (Unexpected token `as`).
- **Lint Status**: `pnpm run lint` passes with one warning (react-hooks/exhaustive-deps in src/auth/BulletproofAuthProvider.jsx:157). docs/lint-backlog.md updated to reflect 2025-10-20 run.
- **Git Hygiene**: Working tree is clean, but `git stash list` shows 19 stashes dating back several branches, including production-critical work (e.g., admin queue revisions). Cleanup plan in repo.plan.md cannot be located (file missing), so previously assigned follow-ups remain unresolved.
- **Documentation Drift**: bmad/tracking/workflow-status.md reports EPIC-002 (mock data elimination) and Sprint 2 as 100% complete. In reality, admin APIs are non-functional, Prisma dependencies are absent, and several frontend components rely on unimplemented backend features. docs/admin-portal.md describes 50+ endpoints, but corresponding controllers/services are partial.

## Deliverables and Next Steps
1. **Stabilise Tests**: Remove or fix broken suites in tests/unit/services/admin and queue monitor logic before claiming admin backend readiness.
2. **Define Data Layer**: Add Prisma schema/migrations for adminApproval, adminQueueMonitor, and related tables or downgrade services to mock data until schema exists.
3. **Admin API Implementation**: Replace 501 placeholders with real logic, wire in MFA verification, and persist audit logs. Align QueueMonitorService with tests or rewrite tests to match intended behaviour.
4. **Working Capital Validation**: Provide integration tests or manual verification plan for new `/optimization/*` endpoints; confirm SSE emission paths and Xero dependency behaviour.
5. **Stash Cleanup**: Inventory stash entries, capture anything important, and drop obsolete items to avoid accidental reapplication during deployments.
6. **Update Roadmap Docs**: Reconcile bmad/tracking/workflow-status.md and related BMAD narratives with actual code status to prevent further drift.
7. **Auth Warning**: Resolve the remaining react-hooks/exhaustive-deps issue in src/auth/BulletproofAuthProvider.jsx before expanding auth stories.

## Git & Deployment Status (2025-10-19)
- **Git HEAD**: `bc51ac3c feat(EPIC-003): Complete UI/UX Polish & Frontend Integration (8/8 stories, 18.5x velocity)` on `main` (local workspace matches origin/main aside from current documentation edits).
- **Local Workspace**: Documentation updates in progress (`DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md`, `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`, BMAD story/status files); application code unchanged.
- **Pull Requests**: `gh pr status` reports PR #13 and #14 targeting `development` with 34/86 checks failing; no PR associated with `main`.
- **Render Deployment**: Frontend `/health` → 200 OK, MCP `/health` → 200 OK, Backend `/api/health` → connection aborted (no healthy deploy). Manual Render shell intervention required.

## Git & Deployment Status Update (2025-10-20T??)
- `git status -sb` confirms `development` == `origin/development`; local changes now include `src/App-simple-environment.jsx` in addition to documentation edits and untracked BMAD files.
- Latest commit on both heads remains `03c4260f fix(prisma): Remove pgvector version specification to fix P3018 deployment error`.
- No CLI evidence of pending pushes or PRs; external GitHub check still required.
- Render deployment health still unverified due to restricted network access—manual dashboard review needed.

## Git & Deployment Status Update (2025-10-20T1)
- `git status -sb` shows `development` == `origin/development`; local edits now include `.claude/settings.local.json` and documentation/BMAD files.
- Latest commit on both heads: `0a7cee55 fix(prisma): Remove pgvector version specification to fix P3018 deployment error`.
- No CLI visibility into PR state; confirm on GitHub if needed.
- Render deployment health still unverified from this sandbox—manual dashboard check required.

## Git & Deployment Status Update (2025-10-20T2)
- `git status -sb` still shows `development` == `origin/development`; local edits now include new auth hooks (`src/hooks/useAuthRedirect.js`, `src/hooks/useRequireAuth.js`) awaiting triage alongside prior documentation/config changes.
- Latest commit on both heads: `0a7cee55 fix(prisma): Remove pgvector version specification to fix P3018 deployment error`.
- No CLI visibility into PR state; confirm on GitHub directly if needed.
- Render deployment health remains unverified from this sandbox—manual dashboard check is required.

## Lint Status Update (2025-10-20)
- `pnpm run lint` now passes with zero findings after updating `src/auth/BulletproofAuthProvider.jsx` dependencies and removing unused retry state.
- `docs/lint-backlog.md` refreshed to reflect clean lint baseline.
## Frontend Loading Skeleton Update (2025-10-20)
- Verified shared skeleton variants in `src/components/ui/skeletons/DashboardSkeleton.jsx` cover KPI, chart, table, form, and widget states.
- Replaced ad-hoc loaders in `ActivityWidget`, `AlertWidget`, `ChartWidget`, `DataTableWidget`, and `StockLevelsWidget` with shared skeletons for consistent UX.
- Standardized working-capital optimization loading flow to render skeleton grids while React Query fetches summary data.
- `pnpm run lint` passes with zero findings after cleanup (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`, `src/components/widgets/StockLevelsWidget.jsx`).
