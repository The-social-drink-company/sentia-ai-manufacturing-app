# BMAD Epic: Deployment Infrastructure Resolution

**Epic ID**: BMAD-INFRA-003
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Phase 1 - Analysis COMPLETE
**Framework**: BMAD-METHOD v6a
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Blocking all deployments)

---

## 🎯 Epic Overview

**Problem Statement**: Render service suspension is blocking all deployments, preventing verification of completed work (Import/Export UI, Dashboard Layout Components) and all future deployments.

**Business Impact**:
- ❌ Cannot deploy completed features to production
- ❌ Cannot verify Import/Export UI (BMAD-UI-001) - 2 weeks of work blocked
- ❌ Cannot verify Dashboard Layout Components (BMAD-INFRA-002) - latest work blocked
- ❌ All future development blocked from deployment
- ❌ Stakeholders cannot see or approve completed work

**Goal**: Restore working deployment pipeline on Render platform.

---

## 📊 Phase 1: ANALYSIS

### Current State Assessment

**Code Status**: ✅ READY
- Import/Export UI complete (PR #16 merged, commit `83ec1923`)
- Dashboard Layout Components complete (PR #18 merged, commit `9c41a83d`)
- All code quality gates passed
- Git history clean and up-to-date

**Deployment Status**: ❌ BLOCKED
- Render service: `sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h.onrender.com`
- Status: **SUSPENDED**
- HTTP Response: 503 Service Unavailable
- Message: "This service has been suspended by its owner"
- Root Cause: Account-level issue (billing/payment/limits/policy)

**Blocker Analysis**:
```
Issue: Render service suspended
Impact: Critical - blocks all deployments
Duration: Unknown - requires account owner intervention
Risk: High - work completed but not verifiable
Dependencies: External - Render account owner access required
```

### Problem Tree

```
ROOT PROBLEM: Cannot deploy or verify completed features
├── IMMEDIATE CAUSE: Render service suspended
│   ├── Possible: Billing/payment issue
│   ├── Possible: Free tier limits exceeded
│   ├── Possible: Manual suspension
│   └── Possible: Policy violation
├── SECONDARY IMPACT: 2+ weeks of work not verifiable
│   ├── Import/Export UI (BMAD-UI-001) - blocked
│   ├── Dashboard Layout (BMAD-INFRA-002) - blocked
│   └── All future work - blocked
└── DEPENDENCY: Requires account owner intervention
    ├── Access to Render dashboard
    ├── Billing/payment resolution
    └── Service reactivation
```

### Options Analysis

#### **Option 1: Wait for Render Service Reactivation** ⏳
**Pros**:
- ✅ No additional work required
- ✅ Existing configuration preserved
- ✅ render.yaml already set up
- ✅ Auto-deploy already configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL database preserved
- ✅ Environment variables already configured
- ✅ No migration needed

**Cons**:
- ❌ Unknown timeline (requires account owner)
- ❌ Blocks all work verification
- ❌ No control over resolution
- ❌ Could be days/weeks
- ❌ No alternative if owner unavailable

**Estimated Timeline**: Unknown (1 hour - 2 weeks)
**Risk Level**: HIGH (no control over timeline)
**Recommendation**: ✅ RECOMMENDED if account owner can be contacted

---

#### **Option 2: Create New Render Service** 🆕
**Setup**: New Render account or service under different account

**Pros**:
- ✅ Familiar platform (Render)
- ✅ Existing render.yaml works
- ✅ Quick setup (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Same deployment workflow
- ✅ Can reuse PostgreSQL connection or create new database

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Requires different Render account (or access granted)
- ⚠️ May hit same suspension issue
- ⚠️ Database migration needed (if creating new DB)
- ⚠️ Environment variable reconfiguration
- ⚠️ New deployment URLs (need to update docs)

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (may repeat suspension)
**Recommendation**: ✅ RECOMMENDED (best alternative if owner unavailable)

---

#### **Option 3: Local Development Environment Enhancement** 🔧
**Setup**: Docker Compose for full-stack local testing

**Pros**:
- ✅ Complete local testing capability
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Fast feedback loop
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Good for development workflow
- ✅ No deployment costs

**Cons**:
- ❌ Not accessible to stakeholders
- ❌ Cannot demo to clients
- ❌ Not a production deployment
- ❌ Setup complexity (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- ❌ Doesn't solve deployment blocker

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 hours
**Risk Level**: LOW (development only)
**Recommendation**: ✅ RECOMMENDED (long-term improvement, not immediate solution)

---

#### **Option 4: Alternative Platform (Railway, Fly.io)** 🔄
**Platforms**: Railway, Fly.io, Heroku (NOT Vercel - project doesn't use it)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Immediate deployment possible (2-4 hours)
- ✅ Verify completed work immediately
- ✅ Unblocks development workflow
- ✅ Provides backup deployment option

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires new configuration (not compatible with render.yaml)
- ❌ Different platform learning curve
- ❌ Environment variable reconfiguration
- ❌ Database migration required
- ❌ May need to revert back to Render later
- ❌ Not aligned with project's Render-only strategy

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 hours
**Risk Level**: HIGH (platform switching complexity)
**Recommendation**: ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED (violates project deployment strategy)

### Decision Matrix

| Option | Timeline | Risk | Cost | Alignment | Control | Score |
|--------|----------|------|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Wait for Render** | **Unknown** | **HIGH** | **$0** | **✅ Perfect** | **LOW** | **6/10** |
| **New Render Service** | **2-3h** | **MED** | **$0-10/mo** | **✅ Perfect** | **HIGH** | **9/10** |
| Local Docker | 4-6h | LOW | $0 | N/A | HIGH | 6/10 |
| Alternative Platform | 4-6h | HIGH | $0-20/mo | ❌ Violates strategy | MED | 3/10 |

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### **Two-Track Approach** (Parallel execution)

**TRACK 1: PRIMARY (Contact Render Account Owner)** 📧
- **Action**: Document suspension issue, request service reactivation
- **Timeline**: Unknown (immediate to 2 weeks)
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Outcome**: Restore primary deployment pipeline
- **Requirements**:
  - Access to Render account owner
  - Billing/payment resolution
  - Service reactivation request

**TRACK 2: BACKUP (Create New Render Service)** 🆕
- **Action**: Set up new Render service under different account
- **Timeline**: 2-3 hours (if account available)
- **Priority**: HIGH (if Track 1 fails or delayed)
- **Outcome**: Alternative Render deployment
- **Requirements**:
  - New Render account (free tier)
  - Copy render.yaml configuration
  - Migrate environment variables
  - Optional: Create new PostgreSQL database or reuse existing

**TRACK 3: LONG-TERM (Docker Local Environment)** 🔧
- **Action**: Create Docker Compose setup for local development
- **Timeline**: Next sprint
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Outcome**: Independence from external deployment for testing

## 🎯 DECISION

**APPROVED SOLUTION**: Two-Track Approach

**Track 1 (Primary)**: Contact Render account owner to resolve suspension
**Track 2 (Backup)**: Prepare new Render service as fallback

**Rationale**:
1. Maintains alignment with project's Render-only deployment strategy
2. Preserves existing configuration (render.yaml, environment variables)
3. Provides backup option if primary resolution delayed
4. Unblocks 2+ weeks of completed work verification
5. Enables stakeholder demos and UAT
6. Maintains development velocity

**NOT using Vercel**: This project uses Render exclusively for all deployments (development, test, production). Alternative platforms like Vercel violate the established deployment architecture.

## 📚 Project Deployment Strategy (from CLAUDE.md)

**Render-Only Deployment**:
- Development branch → sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h.onrender.com

- Environment variables managed in Render dashboard

**NOT using**:
- ❌ Vercel (not part of project architecture)
- ❌ Netlify (not part of project architecture)
- ❌ Heroku (not part of project architecture)
