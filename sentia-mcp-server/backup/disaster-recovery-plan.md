## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backup Configuration

#### Database Backups (PostgreSQL)
```yaml
# Render PostgreSQL Automatic Backups
database_backup:
  frequency: "every_4_hours"
  retention: "30_days"
  encryption: "AES-256"
  compression: "gzip"
  
  # Manual backup triggers
  manual_backup:
    before_deployments: true
    before_major_changes: true
    on_security_incidents: true
    
  # Backup validation
  validation:
    frequency: "daily"
    method: "restore_test"
    location: "separate_environment"
```

#### Application Data Backups
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup script for application data and configuration

BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/app/backups"
S3_BUCKET="sentia-mcp-backups"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE"

# Backup configuration files
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE/config_backup.tar.gz" \
  /app/src/config/ \
  /app/scripts/ \
  /app/package.json \
  /app/render.yaml

# Backup logs (last 7 days)
find /app/logs -name "*.log" -mtime -7 | \
  tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE/logs_backup.tar.gz" -T -

# Backup metrics and monitoring data
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE/monitoring_backup.tar.gz" \
  /app/monitoring/ \
  /app/security/

# Upload to secure storage
aws s3 sync "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE" \
  "s3://$S3_BUCKET/mcp-server/$BACKUP_DATE/" \
  --encryption AES256

# Cleanup local backups older than 7 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;

# Verify backup integrity
aws s3 ls "s3://$S3_BUCKET/mcp-server/$BACKUP_DATE/" --recursive
```

#### Redis Cache Backups
```yaml
# Redis backup configuration
redis_backup:
  method: "RDB_snapshots"
  frequency: "hourly"
  retention: "168_hours"  # 7 days
  
  # AOF (Append Only File) for durability
  aof_enabled: true
  aof_fsync: "everysec"
  
  # Backup to external storage
  external_backup:
    frequency: "daily"
    storage: "render_disk_backup"
    encryption: true
```

### Backup Verification and Testing

#### Automated Backup Testing
```javascript
// Backup verification service
class BackupVerificationService {
  constructor() {
    this.testEnvironment = new TestEnvironment();
    this.logger = createLogger();
  }
  
  async verifyBackups() {
    const backups = await this.getRecentBackups();
    
    for (const backup of backups) {
      try {
        // Test database restore
        await this.testDatabaseRestore(backup.database);
        
        // Test application restore
        await this.testApplicationRestore(backup.application);
        
        // Test configuration restore
        await this.testConfigurationRestore(backup.config);
        
        // Verify data integrity
        await this.verifyDataIntegrity(backup);
        
        this.logger.info('Backup verification successful', {
          backup: backup.id,
          timestamp: backup.timestamp
        });
        
      } catch (error) {
        this.logger.error('Backup verification failed', {
          backup: backup.id,
          error: error.message
        });
        
        // Alert operations team
        await this.alertBackupFailure(backup, error);
      }
    }
  }
  
  async testDatabaseRestore(databaseBackup) {
    const testDb = await this.testEnvironment.createTestDatabase();
    await testDb.restore(databaseBackup);
    
    // Verify data consistency
    const recordCount = await testDb.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables');
    const dataIntegrity = await testDb.checkConstraints();
    
    if (!dataIntegrity.valid) {
      throw new Error('Database backup integrity check failed');
    }
    
    await this.testEnvironment.cleanupTestDatabase(testDb);
  }
}
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Procedure 1: Complete Service Outage

#### Step 1: Incident Detection and Classification
```bash
# Automated health check and alerting
#!/bin/bash

SERVICE_URL="https://sentia-mcp-server-production.onrender.com"
HEALTH_ENDPOINT="$SERVICE_URL/health"

# Check service health
HEALTH_CHECK=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null "$HEALTH_ENDPOINT")

if [ "$HEALTH_CHECK" != "200" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL: Service health check failed with code $HEALTH_CHECK"
  
  # Trigger incident response
  ./trigger-incident-response.sh "service_outage" "$HEALTH_CHECK"
  
  # Begin recovery procedures
  ./begin-recovery.sh "complete_outage"
fi
```

#### Step 2: Service Recovery Process
```yaml
recovery_steps:
  immediate_response:
    - assess_scope: "Determine if single service or infrastructure-wide"
    - check_dependencies: "Verify database, cache, and external services"
    - review_logs: "Check application and infrastructure logs"
    - escalate_if_needed: "Contact Render support for platform issues"
    
  service_restoration:
    - restore_from_backup: "Use most recent verified backup"
    - validate_configuration: "Ensure all environment variables are correct"
    - perform_health_checks: "Verify all endpoints are responding"
    - gradual_traffic_restoration: "Start with health checks, then full traffic"
    
  post_recovery:
    - monitor_performance: "Watch for performance degradation"
    - verify_data_integrity: "Check for any data loss or corruption"
    - update_stakeholders: "Notify users and management of restoration"
    - conduct_post_mortem: "Document lessons learned"
```

### Procedure 2: Database Failure Recovery

#### Database Restoration Process
```sql
-- Database recovery script
-- Execute on fresh PostgreSQL instance

-- 1. Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE sentia_manufacturing_restored;
CREATE USER sentia_recovery WITH PASSWORD 'secure_recovery_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE sentia_manufacturing_restored TO sentia_recovery;

-- 2. Restore from backup
\connect sentia_manufacturing_restored;

-- Restore schema
\i /backups/latest/schema_backup.sql

-- Restore data
\i /backups/latest/data_backup.sql

-- 3. Verify data integrity
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins as inserts,
  n_tup_upd as updates,
  n_tup_del as deletes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

-- 4. Check constraints and indexes
SELECT 
  conname,
  contype,
  convalidated
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE NOT convalidated;

-- 5. Update statistics
ANALYZE;
```

#### Application Configuration Update
```javascript
// Update database connection after restoration
const databaseConfig = {
  connectionString: process.env.RECOVERY_DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000
};

// Test connection before switching
async function validateDatabaseConnection(config) {
  const pool = new Pool(config);
  
  try {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    const result = await client.query('SELECT NOW() as current_time');
    client.release();
    
    console.log('Database connection validated:', result.rows[0].current_time);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Database connection validation failed:', error);
    return false;
  } finally {
    await pool.end();
  }
}
```

### Procedure 3: Security Incident Recovery

    actions:
      - "Remove malicious code or unauthorized access"
      - "Patch vulnerabilities that enabled the incident"
      - "Update security controls and monitoring"
      - "Strengthen authentication and authorization"
      
  phase_4_recovery:
    duration: "4-24 hours"
    actions:
      - "Restore services from clean backups"
      - "Implement additional monitoring"
      - "Gradual restoration of normal operations"
      - "Continuous monitoring for recurrence"
      
  phase_5_lessons_learned:
    duration: "1-2 weeks"
    actions:
      - "Conduct thorough post-incident review"
      - "Update incident response procedures"
      - "Implement additional preventive measures"
      - "Provide staff training on lessons learned"
```

#### Security Recovery Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash

```

## Geographic Redundancy and Multi-Region Setup

### Multi-Region Architecture
```yaml
regions:
  primary:
    region: "us-west-2"
    services:
      - mcp_server_primary
      - database_primary
      - cache_primary
    traffic_percentage: 80
    
  secondary:
    region: "us-east-1"
    services:
      - mcp_server_secondary
      - database_replica
      - cache_replica
    traffic_percentage: 20
    
  disaster_recovery:
    region: "eu-west-1"
    services:
      - cold_standby_mcp_server
      - database_backup_replica
    traffic_percentage: 0
    activation_time: "2 hours"
```

### Failover Procedures
```javascript
// Automatic failover logic
class FailoverManager {
  constructor() {
    this.healthChecker = new HealthChecker();
    this.trafficManager = new TrafficManager();
    this.logger = createLogger();
  }
  
  async monitorAndFailover() {
    const primaryHealth = await this.healthChecker.checkPrimary();
    
    if (!primaryHealth.healthy) {
      this.logger.warn('Primary region unhealthy, initiating failover');
      
      // Check secondary region health
      const secondaryHealth = await this.healthChecker.checkSecondary();
      
      if (secondaryHealth.healthy) {
        await this.failoverToSecondary();
      } else {
        await this.activateDisasterRecovery();
      }
    }
  }
  
  async failoverToSecondary() {
    // Update DNS to point to secondary region
    await this.trafficManager.updateDNS('secondary');
    
    // Scale up secondary region
    await this.scaleSecondaryRegion();
    
    // Update monitoring
    await this.updateMonitoringTargets('secondary');
    
    this.logger.info('Failover to secondary region completed');
  }
}
