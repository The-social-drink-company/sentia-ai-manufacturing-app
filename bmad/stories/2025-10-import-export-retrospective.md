## 🔧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: SSE Connection Management
**Problem**: SSE connections needed proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Solution**:
- Implemented `useSSE` hook with automatic cleanup
- Added connection state tracking (connected, error, disconnected)
- Automatic reconnection on failure

**Learning**: Always use cleanup functions in React hooks for event sources

### Challenge 2: File Size Limits
**Problem**: Large file uploads (50MB) required special handling

**Solution**:
- Implemented streaming file processing
- Chunked validation for large datasets
- Progress tracking per chunk

**Learning**: Stream processing is essential for large data operations

### Challenge 3: Column Mapping Auto-Detection
**Problem**: Needed intelligent mapping between source and target columns

**Solution**:
- Fuzzy matching algorithm for column names
- Confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Manual override capability

**Learning**: AI/ML can enhance UX but manual controls are essential

### Challenge 4: Queue Job Management
**Problem**: Needed visibility into background job processing

**Solution**:
- Built QueueManagement admin page
- Real-time job status display
- Retry/cancel controls

**Learning**: Admin tooling is critical for production debugging

## 🚀 Technical Innovations

### 1. **BullMQ Queue Architecture**
```javascript
// Retry logic with exponential backoff
const jobOptions = {
  attempts: 3,
  backoff: {
    type: 'exponential',
    delay: 2000
  }
};
```

### 2. **Real-time Progress via SSE**
```javascript
// Server-side event streaming
sseEmitter.emit(jobId, {
  type: 'import:progress',
  progress: Math.round((processed / total) * 100),
  processedRows: processed,
  succeededRows: succeeded,
  failedRows: failed
});
```

### 3. **Schema-based Validation**
```javascript
// Flexible validation engine
const rules = {
  required: (value) => value !== null && value !== undefined,
  type: (value, expected) => typeof value === expected,
  range: (value, min, max) => value >= min && value <= max,
  pattern: (value, regex) => new RegExp(regex).test(value)
};
```

### 4. **RBAC-Aware Components**
```javascript
// Permission-based rendering
{hasPermission('import:manage') && (
  <ImportWizardButton />
)}
```

- Service layer separation improves testability
- Admin tooling is essential for production support

### React Best Practices
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (useSSE, useImportExport)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Controlled components for form state
- Error boundaries for graceful degradation

### Security Principles

3. ✅ **Modular architecture** - Makes testing and maintenance easier
4. ✅ **Documentation-first approach** - Prevents implementation drift

### What to Start
1. 🆕 **Integration tests earlier** - Currently deferred to Phase 3
2. 🆕 **Performance profiling during development** - Catch issues sooner
3. 🆕 **Accessibility testing per component** - Don't batch at end
4. 🆕 **Code review checkpoints mid-epic** - Catch architectural issues early

### What to Stop
1. 🛑 **Deferring test writing** - Tests should be concurrent with implementation
