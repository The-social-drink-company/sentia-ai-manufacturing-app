## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX

### Risk Calculation Formula
**Risk Score = Impact × Probability × Complexity**

### Impact Scoring
| Score | Description | Business Impact |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| 5 | Critical | Complete service outage, data loss |
| 4 | High | Major feature unavailable |
| 3 | Medium | Performance degradation |
| 2 | Low | Minor feature impact |
| 1 | Minimal | No user impact |

### Probability Scoring
| Score | Description | Likelihood |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 5 | Very High | >80% chance |
| 4 | High | 60-80% chance |
| 3 | Medium | 40-60% chance |
| 2 | Low | 20-40% chance |
| 1 | Very Low | <20% chance |

### Complexity Scoring
| Score | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| 5 | Very Complex | Multiple systems, external dependencies |
| 4 | Complex | Cross-service changes |
| 3 | Moderate | Single service, multiple components |
| 2 | Simple | Single component |
| 1 | Trivial | Configuration only |

### Risk Thresholds
- **Score > 60**: Executive approval required
- **Score 30-60**: CAB approval required
- **Score 15-30**: Team Lead approval
- **Score < 15**: Automated approval

## 5. ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Rollback Decision Criteria
1. **Immediate Rollback Triggers**:
   - Production outage lasting >5 minutes
   - Data corruption detected
   - Security breach identified
   - Performance degradation >50%

2. **Escalated Review Triggers**:
   - Error rate increase >20%
   - Customer complaints >10
   - Failed health checks
   - Memory/CPU usage >90%

### Rollback Execution Steps

#### Railway Platform Rollback
```bash
# 1. Identify last stable deployment
railway deployments list --environment production

# 2. Rollback to specific deployment
railway rollback <deployment-id> --environment production

# 3. Verify rollback
railway status --environment production

# 4. Clear cache and restart
railway restart --environment production
```

#### Database Rollback
```sql
-- 1. Identify rollback point
SELECT * FROM migration_history ORDER BY executed_at DESC;

-- 2. Execute rollback migration
npx prisma migrate rollback --to <migration-id>

-- 3. Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM system_health_checks;
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. **Immediate** (0-15 minutes):
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Verify system stability
   - Document rollback reason

2. **Short-term** (15-60 minutes):
   - Root cause analysis
   - Create incident report
   - Update runbooks

3. **Long-term** (1-24 hours):
   - Post-mortem meeting
   - Process improvement
   - Training updates
