## üéØ Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Alert (0-5 minutes)

#### Automatic Detection

```bash
# Health monitoring alert
.\scripts\health-monitor.ps1 -Mode continuous

# Check alert source
- Railway alerts
- Sentry errors
- Uptime monitoring
- User reports
```

#### Initial Assessment

1. **Verify the incident**

   ```bash
   curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.up.railway.app/api/health
   ```

2. **Determine severity**
   - How many users affected?
   - Which features impacted?
   - Is data at risk?

3. **Create incident**

   ```bash
   # Create Slack channel
   /incident create [title]

   # Log incident
   echo "$(date): Incident detected - [description]" >> incidents.log
   ```

### Phase 2: Response & Communication (5-15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions

1. **Assign roles**
   - Incident Commander
   - Technical Lead
   - Communications Lead

2. **Start incident timeline**

   ```markdown
   ## Incident Timeline

   - [TIME] Alert received
   - [TIME] Incident confirmed
   - [TIME] Team assembled
   ```

3. **Initial communication**

   ```markdown
   Subject: [P1] System Issue Detected

   We are aware of an issue affecting [service].
   Impact: [description]
   Status: Investigating
   Next update: In 15 minutes
   ```

### Phase 3: Diagnosis (15-30 minutes)

#### System Health Checks

```bash
# 1. Check all environments
.\scripts\health-monitor.ps1 -Mode once

# 2. Review recent deployments
railway deployments --service 9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343

# 3. Check error logs
railway logs --service 9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343 --since 1h | grep ERROR

# 4. Database status
.\scripts\database-operations.ps1 -Operation status -Environment production

# 5. External service status
curl https://api.clerk.dev/v1/health
curl https://api.xero.com/health
```

#### Common Diagnosis Patterns

**High Error Rate**

```bash
# Check error patterns
railway logs --service [service-id] | grep -E "ERROR|FATAL|CRITICAL" | head -50

# Check Sentry for error clustering
# Review error trends in monitoring dashboard
```

**Performance Issues**

```bash
# Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null https://[domain]/api/health

# Review database slow queries
# Check memory/CPU usage
railway metrics --service [service-id]
```

**Connection Issues**

```bash
# Test database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

# Check external APIs
curl -I https://api.xero.com
curl -I https://api.shopify.com
```

### Phase 4: Mitigation (30+ minutes)

#### Quick Fixes

**1. Service Restart**

```bash
railway restart --service 9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343 --environment production
```

**2. Scale Resources**

```bash
# Increase replicas via Railway dashboard
# Increase memory/CPU limits
```

**3. Feature Toggle**

```bash
# Disable problematic feature
railway variables set ENABLE_FEATURE=false --service [service-id]
```

**4. Rollback Deployment**

```bash
# List recent deployments
railway deployments --service [service-id]

# Rollback to last known good
railway rollback [deployment-id] --service [service-id]
```

**5. Database Recovery**

```bash
# Restore from backup
.\scripts\database-operations.ps1 -Operation restore -Environment production -BackupFile [file]
```

### Phase 5: Resolution

#### Verification Steps

1. **Confirm fix deployed**

   ```bash
   railway status --service [service-id]
   ```

2. **Test critical paths**
   - User login
   - Dashboard loading
   - API responses
   - Data integrity

3. **Monitor for 30 minutes**
   ```bash
   .\scripts\health-monitor.ps1 -Mode continuous -IntervalSeconds 60
   ```

#### Communication

```markdown
Subject: [RESOLVED] System Issue Resolved

The issue affecting [service] has been resolved.
Duration: [start] - [end]
Impact: [description]
Resolution: [what was done]
Next steps: Monitoring for stability
```
