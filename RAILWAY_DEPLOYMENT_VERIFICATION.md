## üìã Railway Dashboard Verification Steps

### Step 1: Access Your Project
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/6d1ca9b2-75e2-46c6-86a8-ed05161112fe
2. Log in with your Railway account

### Step 2: Verify Each Environment

#### For Development Environment:
1. Click on "development" environment tab
2. Check for service named "sentia-manufacturing-dashboard"
3. If no service exists:
   - Click "New Service"
   - Choose "GitHub Repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Choose "development" branch
4. Verify deployment status (should show "Building" or "Active")

#### For Testing Environment:
1. Click on "testing" environment tab
2. Repeat service creation if needed
3. Ensure it's linked to "test" branch

#### For Production Environment:
1. Click on "production" environment tab
2. Repeat service creation if needed
3. Ensure it's linked to "production" branch

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
For each environment:
1. Click on the service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Confirm you see all 55+ variables including:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - All API keys

### Step 4: Check Deployment Logs
1. Click on the service
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click on latest deployment
4. Check build logs for:
   - "Using Nixpacks" (NOT Docker)
   - "npm install" completing
   - "npm start" running
   - No errors about missing Dockerfile

### Step 5: Test Application Endpoints

```bash
# Development
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-development.up.railway.app/api/health

# Testing
curl https://sentiatest.financeflo.ai/api/health

# Production
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "[environment_name]",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T..."
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### If You See "Dockerfile not found" Error:
‚úÖ **Already Fixed**: We've updated nixpacks.toml to use Express
- The fix has been pushed to GitHub
- Railway should auto-deploy with correct configuration

### If Services Don't Exist:
**Action Required**: Create services manually in Railway dashboard
1. Go to each environment
2. Click "New Service"
3. Choose "GitHub Repo"
4. Connect your repository
5. Select appropriate branch

### If Variables Are Missing:
They've been set via CLI, but if not showing:
```bash
# Re-run the script for that environment
.\scripts\set-railway-vars-batch.ps1 -Environment [development|testing|production]
```

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check build logs for specific error
2. Verify package.json has correct scripts:
   - `"start": "node server.js"`
   - `"build": "vite build"`
3. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

## üìä Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Environment Variables | ‚úÖ Complete | None |
| Nixpacks Configuration | ‚úÖ Fixed | None |
| GitHub Repository | ‚úÖ Updated | None |
| Railway Services | ‚è≥ Pending | Check dashboard |
| Auto-deployment | ‚è≥ Pending | Monitor dashboard |

## üéØ Final Steps for Go-Live

1. **Verify Services in Railway Dashboard**
   - Ensure all three environments have services
   - Check deployment status

2. **Test Each Environment**
   - Access the application URLs
   - Test API health endpoints
   - Verify Clerk authentication works

3. **Monitor First Deployments**
   - Watch build logs
   - Check for any errors
   - Verify application starts correctly

4. **Update DNS (if custom domains)**
   - Point domains to Railway URLs
   - Update SSL certificates if needed

## üìù Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check current environment
railway status

# Switch environments
railway environment development
railway environment testing
railway environment production

# View logs
railway logs --service sentia-manufacturing-dashboard

# List all variables
railway variables

# Deploy manually (if needed)
railway up --service sentia-manufacturing-dashboard

# Link to project (if disconnected)
railway link --project 6d1ca9b2-75e2-46c6-86a8-ed05161112fe
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
1. All three environments show "Active" status in Railway
2. Health check endpoints respond with 200 OK
3. Application loads in browser
4. Clerk authentication works
5. Database connections are established

**Remember**: We use **Nixpacks with Express**, NOT Docker or Caddy. The configuration is complete and correct. Railway will automatically deploy when services are created and linked to GitHub branches.
