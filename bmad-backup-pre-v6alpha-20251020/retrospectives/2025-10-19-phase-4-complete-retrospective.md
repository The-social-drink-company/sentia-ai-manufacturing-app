## 🔧 What Could Be Improved

### Current Limitations

**Phase 4.1 (Landing Page)**:
1. Dashboard mockup is simple colored rectangles (needs realistic UI)
2. Customer logos are placeholder text (needs real company logos)
3. Team member photos are placeholders
4. No actual video for "Watch Demo" CTA

**Phase 4.2 (Features & Blog)**:
1. Feature screenshots are mockups (need real product screenshots)
2. Integration logos are text-based (need actual company logos)
3. Blog posts are embedded in components (should be MDX files)
4. No actual MDX loader configured
5. Newsletter signup doesn't connect to email service
6. No RSS feed generated
7. SEO meta tags not yet implemented
8. Social sharing buttons functional but not tested

### Process Improvements

1. **Asset Management**: Need centralized asset library for images, logos
2. **MDX Setup**: Should configure MDX loader and create actual .mdx files
3. **Email Integration**: Connect newsletter to Mailchimp/ConvertKit
4. **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics, Hotjar tracking
5. **Testing**: Run Lighthouse audit, cross-browser testing
