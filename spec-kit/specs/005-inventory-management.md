# Feature Specification: Inventory Management

**Feature Branch**: `005-inventory-management`
**Created**: September 26, 2025
**Status**: In Development
**Input**: User description: "Advanced inventory management system with real-time stock tracking, demand forecasting, supplier management, reorder optimization, and comprehensive inventory analytics for manufacturing operations"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted: stock management, demand planning, supplier coordination, reorder automation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Inventory Manager, Production Planner, Purchasing Manager, Warehouse Staff
   → Actions: track, forecast, optimize, reorder, analyze, alert
   → Data: stock levels, movements, suppliers, demand patterns, costs
   → Constraints: real-time accuracy, automated thresholds, compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Stock categories: Raw materials, WIP, finished goods, consumables
   → Reorder methods: Min/Max, Economic Order Quantity, Just-in-time
   → Forecast periods: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear workflow: Monitor stock → analyze trends → optimize reorders → track performance
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement measurable and testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Items, locations, movements, suppliers, forecasts, orders
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear and unambiguous
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an Inventory Manager, I need comprehensive visibility into stock levels, demand patterns, and supplier performance to optimize inventory investment, prevent stockouts, reduce carrying costs, and maintain optimal service levels for production operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** current stock data, **When** viewing the inventory dashboard, **Then** I see real-time stock levels with visual indicators for low stock within 2 seconds
2. **Given** historical demand data, **When** generating forecasts, **Then** the system provides accurate demand predictions with confidence intervals for 30/60/90-day periods
3. **Given** reorder parameters, **When** stock hits minimum levels, **Then** automated purchase requisitions are generated with optimal quantities
4. **Given** supplier performance data, **When** analyzing vendor metrics, **Then** I see delivery performance, quality scores, and cost trends
5. **Given** inventory movements, **When** tracking stock transactions, **Then** all movements are logged with timestamps, users, and reasons
6. **Given** ABC classification criteria, **When** categorizing inventory, **Then** items are automatically classified with appropriate management strategies

### Edge Cases
- What happens when demand spikes unexpectedly? → Dynamic safety stock adjustments with alert notifications
- How does the system handle seasonal variations? → Seasonal forecasting models with historical pattern recognition
- What if suppliers fail to deliver? → Backup supplier activation with automated procurement workflows
- How to handle obsolete inventory? → Aging analysis with disposition recommendations and write-off procedures

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time inventory levels for all stock items with last update timestamps
