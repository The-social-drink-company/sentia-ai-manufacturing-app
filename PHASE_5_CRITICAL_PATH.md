- ‚úÖ **xlsx package**: High severity prototype pollution - no fix available (documented)
- ‚úÖ **esbuild**: Development server vulnerability - update to >0.24.2 required

#### Security Hardening Tasks
1. **Run npm audit fix** - Address all fixable vulnerabilities
2. **Update dependencies** - Resolve esbuild and other security issues
3. **Document unfixable vulnerabilities** - Create security assessment report
4. **Implement CSP headers** - Content Security Policy for production
5. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Priority 2: Performance Optimization (HIGH)
**Impact**: Production SLA compliance
**Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### Target Metrics
- **API Response Time**: <200ms (current: <500ms)
- **Dashboard Load**: <3 seconds (current: ~3-5 seconds)
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 1,000+ users
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize for production workloads

#### Optimization Tasks
1. **Database Query Optimization** - Index key queries, optimize joins
2. **API Endpoint Caching** - Implement Redis caching layer
3. **Bundle Size Reduction** - Code splitting and lazy loading
4. **Database Connection Pooling** - Prevent connection exhaustion
5. **CDN Configuration** - Static asset optimization

### Priority 3: Test Infrastructure (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Code quality and confidence
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

#### Testing Fixes Required
1. **Fix npm test command** - Install jsdom dependency
2. **Increase test coverage** - Target 80% coverage for critical paths
3. **E2E test setup** - Playwright configuration fixes
4. **Load testing** - Validate performance under load

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Items
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Some may require breaking changes
2. **Performance Targets**: <200ms may require significant optimization
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Complex setup may take longer than expected

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel Execution**: Run security fixes and performance optimization simultaneously
2. **Fallback Plans**: Document performance benchmarks even if not meeting <200ms target
3. **Minimum Viable Testing**: Focus on critical path testing if time constraints arise
