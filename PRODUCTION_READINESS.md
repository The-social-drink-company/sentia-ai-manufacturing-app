## Configuration Commands

### Set Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Use Railway CLI
railway variables set KEY=value --service 9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343 --environment production

# Or use Railway Dashboard
https://railway.app/project/6d1ca9b2-75e2-46c6-86a8-ed05161112fe/service/9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy latest code
.\deploy-railway.ps1 production

# Verify deployment
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### Monitor Production
```bash
# View logs
railway logs --service 9fd67b0e-7883-4973-85a5-639d9513d343 --environment production

# Run health check
.\scripts\health-monitor.ps1 -Mode once
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Missing API Keys**: Application won't function without external integrations
2. **Database Not Configured**: No data persistence
3. **Authentication Broken**: Users can't access system

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to subset of users first
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable features gradually
3. **Rollback Plan**: Previous version ready to deploy
4. **Monitoring**: Immediate alerts for issues
