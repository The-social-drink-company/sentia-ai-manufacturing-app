## Working Capital & Finance

### Understanding Financial Metrics

**Q: What is working capital and why is it important?**
A: Working capital basics:
```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Example:
Current Assets: £500,000
├── Cash: £100,000
├── Accounts Receivable: £200,000
└── Inventory: £200,000

Current Liabilities: £250,000
├── Accounts Payable: £150,000
├── Short-term Debt: £75,000
└── Accrued Expenses: £25,000

Working Capital = £500,000 - £250,000 = £250,000
```

**Importance:**
- **Cash Flow**: Measures ability to pay short-term obligations
- **Growth**: Adequate working capital enables business expansion
- **Efficiency**: Optimal levels indicate efficient operations
- **Risk Management**: Low levels can signal financial distress

**Q: What's a good current ratio?**
A: Current ratio guidelines:
- **Below 1.0**: Potential liquidity problems
- **1.0 - 1.5**: Adequate but tight liquidity
- **1.5 - 3.0**: Good liquidity position (ideal range)
- **Above 3.0**: Excess cash, may indicate poor capital allocation

Industry variations:
- **Manufacturing**: 1.5 - 2.5 typical
- **Retail**: 1.2 - 2.0 typical
- **Service**: 1.0 - 1.5 typical

**Q: How often should I review my cash flow forecast?**
A: Recommended review frequency:
- **Daily**: For businesses with tight cash flow
- **Weekly**: For most small-medium businesses (recommended)
- **Bi-weekly**: For businesses with stable cash flow
- **Monthly**: Minimum frequency for any business

**Update triggers:**
- Large customer payments received
- Unexpected expenses
- New orders or contracts
- Changes in payment terms
- Seasonal business variations

### Cash Flow Management

**Q: How accurate are the cash flow forecasts?**
A: Forecast accuracy factors:
- **Data Quality**: Better data = more accurate forecasts
- **Historical Patterns**: 6+ months of data improves accuracy
- **Business Stability**: Stable businesses have higher accuracy
- **External Factors**: Market changes can affect accuracy

**Typical accuracy rates:**
- **30 days**: 85-95% accurate
- **60 days**: 75-90% accurate  
- **90 days**: 65-85% accurate

**Improving accuracy:**
- Regular customer payment follow-up
- Accurate sales pipeline management
- Conservative assumptions
- Regular forecast updates

**Q: What should I do if the forecast shows a cash shortfall?**
A: Cash shortfall action plan:

**Immediate Actions (0-7 days):**
1. **Accelerate Receipts**:
   - Contact overdue customers
   - Offer early payment discounts
   - Factor/sell receivables
   - Collect prepayments for new orders

2. **Delay Payments**:
   - Negotiate extended terms with suppliers
   - Prioritize critical payments only
   - Use available credit facilities
   - Postpone non-essential purchases

**Short-term Actions (1-4 weeks):**
1. **Increase Cash Inflow**:
   - Liquidate excess inventory
   - Sell non-essential assets
   - Accelerate sales activities
   - Implement stricter credit policies

2. **Reduce Cash Outflow**:
   - Cut discretionary spending
   - Delay capital investments
