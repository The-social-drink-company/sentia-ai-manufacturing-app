## Current Snapshot (2025-10-20)

| Service  | Deploy Status            | Health Check                     | Notes |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| Frontend | Last deploy succeeded    | Blocked pending Clerk key        | VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY still missing; do not redeploy until backend stable |
| Backend  | Last deploy partial      | Connection aborted (Render 502)  | Prisma migrations and data layer incomplete; vitest suites failing; requires remediation before redeploy |
| MCP      | Not re-verified (assume) | Previous check 200 OK (2025-10-19) | No new data; re-run after backend redeploy |

---

## Reality Check vs 2025-10-19 Entry

- 2025-10-19 report logged backend /api/health = 200 OK. Latest audit (2025-10-20) observed connection aborted; backend not healthy.
- Documentation claimed deployment chain 95% complete with only Clerk key outstanding. Current blockers include missing Prisma models, failing vitest suites, and unresolved admin services.
- Render migration command conflicts are resolved in code, but redeploy must wait until schema and service fixes are complete.

---

## Required Actions (Blocking)

1. Define Prisma schema and migrations for adminApproval, working-capital records, queue monitors.
2. Update backend services to use the new schema and replace 501 placeholders with real implementations.
3. Stabilize vitest (`vitest --run` currently 7 suites / 41 tests failing).
4. Re-run Render backend deployment (prisma migrate resolve/status, restart service) and confirm /api/health returns 200.
5. Set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and rerun frontend deploy once backend is healthy.
6. Re-verify MCP health endpoints after backend redeploy to ensure no regressions.
