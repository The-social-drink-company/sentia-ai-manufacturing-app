## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING WORK: 2-5% COMPLETION

### Critical Issues to Resolve

#### 1. Build Pipeline Stability (2%)
**Issue**: npm cache corruption preventing clean builds
**Impact**: Cannot install new packages or run fresh builds
**Solution**: Clear npm cache and reinstall dependencies
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### 2. Test Execution Environment (1%)
**Issue**: vitest command not recognized in Windows PATH
**Impact**: Cannot run automated test suite
**Solution**: Use npx or direct binary execution
```bash
npx vitest run
```

#### 3. Final Production Validation (2%)
**Issue**: Need comprehensive end-to-end testing
**Impact**: Cannot guarantee 100% production readiness
**Solution**: Systematic testing of all features in production
