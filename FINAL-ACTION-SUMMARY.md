## ❌ What's Missing (ONLY ONE THING):

### Environment Variables in Render Dashboard

**The ONLY reason production is down:**
- Clerk authentication keys are not configured in Render
- Without these, the server cannot start
- This causes the 502 error

---

## 🎯 THE SINGLE ACTION NEEDED:

### Go to Render Dashboard and Add These Variables:

```bash
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_REDACTED
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_REDACTED
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_REDACTED
VITE_CLERK_DOMAIN=clerk.financeflo.ai
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_REDACTED
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
API_BASE_URL=/api
```

**Where**: https://dashboard.render.com → sentia-manufacturing-production → Environment
