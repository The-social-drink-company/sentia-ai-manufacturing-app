FORCE CACHE CLEAR: Railway Complete Rebuild Required
Time: Mon, Sep 8, 2025  2:45 PM

CRITICAL ISSUE: Production still serving cached build with ClerkProvider duplicate error
Console Error: "vendor-CoorQe56.js:10 Uncaught Error: @clerk/clerk-react: You've added multiple <ClerkProvider> components"

CHANGES MADE TO FORCE CACHE CLEAR:
✅ Removed all temporary deployment trigger files
✅ Removed deprecated documentation and context files  
✅ Updated package.json prebuild to clear node_modules/.cache
✅ Added --force flag to vite build command
✅ Removed all log files and build artifacts locally
✅ Code is correct - only ONE ClerkProvider in App.jsx
✅ No ClerkProvider in main.jsx (as intended)
✅ Fixed TrendingUpIcon import issue

RAILWAY NEEDS TO:
1. Clear all build cache completely
2. Delete old vendor-CoorQe56.js bundle 
3. Build fresh with current code
4. Generate new bundle hashes
5. Stop serving stale cached builds

The ClerkProvider duplicate error ONLY exists in the cached build.
Fresh builds should work correctly.
