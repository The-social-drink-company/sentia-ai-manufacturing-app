## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Purpose
This Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP) ensures the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard can recover from catastrophic events and maintain critical business operations within defined time objectives.

### Key Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours for critical systems
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 hour for data recovery
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: 8 hours
- **Work Recovery Time (WRT)**: 2 hours post-restoration

### Critical Success Factors
- Automated backup validation every 6 hours
- Multi-region failover capability
- Real-time replication for critical data
- Tested recovery procedures quarterly

## 3. RECOVERY STRATEGIES

### 3.1 Database Recovery

#### Primary Strategy: Point-in-Time Recovery
```sql
-- Neon PostgreSQL Recovery Commands
-- 1. Identify recovery point
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;

-- 2. Create recovery branch
neon branch create recovery-branch --from-timestamp "2025-09-14 10:00:00"

-- 3. Restore to specific point
neon restore --branch recovery-branch --to-timestamp "2025-09-14 10:00:00"

-- 4. Validate data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM critical_tables;
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM audit_logs;
```

#### Backup Schedule
- **Continuous**: Transaction log streaming to S3
- **Hourly**: Incremental backups
- **Daily**: Full database snapshot at 02:00 UTC
- **Weekly**: Archived backup to cold storage

#### Backup Validation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-validation.sh

# Test backup restoration
echo "Starting backup validation..."

# Create test database
neon database create test-restore

# Restore latest backup
pg_restore -d test-restore latest-backup.sql

# Validate critical tables
psql test-restore -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
psql test-restore -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;"

# Clean up test database
neon database delete test-restore

echo "Backup validation complete"
```

### 3.2 Application Recovery

#### Railway Platform Recovery
```bash
# 1. Check deployment status
railway status --environment production

# 2. Rollback to last stable version
railway deployments list --environment production
railway rollback <stable-deployment-id>

# 3. Force restart if needed
railway restart --environment production

# 4. Scale up instances for recovery
railway scale --replicas 5 --environment production
```

#### Docker Container Recovery (Alternative)
```yaml
# docker-compose.recovery.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: sentia-dashboard:latest-stable
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      restart_policy:
        condition: any
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=recovery
      - DATABASE_URL=${BACKUP_DATABASE_URL}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

### 3.3 Data Recovery Procedures

#### Critical Data Recovery Priority
1. **User Authentication Data** (5 minutes)
2. **Financial Transactions** (15 minutes)
3. **Inventory Data** (30 minutes)
4. **Order History** (45 minutes)
5. **Analytics Data** (60 minutes)
6. **Audit Logs** (90 minutes)

#### Recovery Validation Checklist
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Data integrity validated
- [ ] External integrations connected
- [ ] Performance metrics normal
- [ ] Monitoring systems active

---

## 4. FAILOVER PROCEDURES

### 4.1 Automatic Failover Configuration

```javascript
// failover-config.js
export const failoverConfig = {
  primary: {
    region: 'us-east-1',
    endpoint: 'https://sentiaprod.financeflo.ai',
    healthCheck: '/health',
    threshold: 3 // failed checks before failover
  },
  secondary: {
    region: 'eu-west-1',
    endpoint: 'https://sentia-dr.financeflo.ai',
    healthCheck: '/health',
    warmStandby: true
  },
  monitoring: {
    interval: 30, // seconds
    timeout: 5, // seconds
    alertChannels: ['slack', 'email', 'pagerduty']
  }
};
```

### 4.2 Manual Failover Process

1. **Detection Phase** (0-5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Check primary health
   curl -f https://sentiaprod.financeflo.ai/health || echo "Primary is down"

   # Verify secondary readiness
   curl -f https://sentia-dr.financeflo.ai/health || echo "Secondary not ready"
   ```

2. **Decision Phase** (5-10 minutes)
   - Assess impact and duration
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Authorize failover

3. **Execution Phase** (10-20 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Update DNS to point to secondary
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
     --hosted-zone-id Z123456 \
     --change-batch file://failover-dns.json

   # Scale secondary resources
   railway scale --replicas 10 --environment dr

   # Enable read-write on secondary database
   neon database promote --branch dr-standby
   ```

4. **Validation Phase** (20-30 minutes)
   - Verify all services operational
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Monitor performance metrics

### 4.3 Failback Procedures

```bash
# 1. Ensure primary is fully recovered
./health-check.sh primary full

# 2. Sync data from secondary to primary
pg_dump secondary_db | psql primary_db

# 3. Switch traffic back to primary
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456 \
  --change-batch file://failback-dns.json

# 4. Demote secondary to standby
railway scale --replicas 2 --environment dr
```

# Select backup to restore
BACKUP_FILE=$1

if [ -z "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./restore-database.sh <backup_file>"
    exit 1
fi

# Download from S3 if needed
if [[ $BACKUP_FILE == s3://* ]]; then
    aws s3 cp $BACKUP_FILE /tmp/restore.sql
    BACKUP_FILE="/tmp/restore.sql"
fi

# Create restoration point
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > "/backups/pre_restore_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"

# Restore database
psql $DATABASE_URL < $BACKUP_FILE

# Validate restoration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
