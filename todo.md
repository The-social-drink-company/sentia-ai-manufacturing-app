- [x] Fix undefined identifiers in the what-if scenario builder ('src/features/what-if/components/ScenarioBuilder.jsx' lines 58-88) so 'scenarioId' and 'variable' are sourced from component state.
- [x] Unblock hook-order violations in forecasting/inventory auth flows ('src/features/forecasting/ForecastingDashboard.jsx' line 59, 'src/features/inventory/components/ABCAnalysis.jsx' lines 43/83, 'src/pages/ClerkSignIn.jsx' lines 22-23).
- [x] Restore missing helpers in the working capital API ('server/api/working-capital.js' lines 47-108) to clear 'no-undef' errors for 'calculateChange', 'getPeriodCount', etc.
