## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Production Manager, I need real-time visibility into manufacturing operations, OEE metrics, and production schedules to optimize throughput, minimize downtime, and ensure on-time delivery while maintaining quality standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a production user accesses the dashboard, **When** they load the production page, **Then** they see current job status and OEE metrics within 5 seconds
2. **Given** production machines are running, **When** monitoring operations, **Then** they see real-time availability, performance, and quality metrics
3. **Given** production schedules exist, **When** viewing job progress, **Then** they see planned vs actual progress with variance analysis
4. **Given** quality data is collected, **When** analyzing defect rates, **Then** system shows quality trends and Pareto analysis
5. **Given** downtime events occur, **When** logging incidents, **Then** system categorizes by reason and calculates impact
6. **Given** shift changes happen, **When** handover occurs, **Then** system generates shift summary reports
7. **Given** capacity constraints exist, **When** scheduling jobs, **Then** system highlights bottlenecks and suggests alternatives

### Edge Cases
- What happens during equipment breakdowns? ’ Automatic alerts to maintenance with priority scoring and estimated repair time
- How does system handle rush orders? ’ Dynamic rescheduling with impact analysis and resource reallocation
- What if quality issues arise? ’ Quality holds with root cause analysis and corrective action tracking
- How to manage multi-shift operations? ’ 24/7 continuous monitoring with shift-specific KPIs and handover protocols
