## Database Setup

### Step 8: Configure Neon PostgreSQL Database

The application uses Neon PostgreSQL as the primary database with vector capabilities for AI operations.

#### Database Connection Setup

1. **Verify Database Access**
   - Ensure your Neon PostgreSQL database is accessible
   - Test the connection string from your local environment
   - Verify the database has the required extensions installed

2. **Database Schema Preparation**
   ```sql
   -- Enable required extensions
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "vector";
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_trgm";
   
   -- Create application schema
   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS sentia_manufacturing;
   ```

3. **Connection Pool Configuration**
   - The application is configured for connection pooling
   - Minimum connections: 5
   - Maximum connections: 20
   - Connection timeout: 30 seconds

#### Database Migration (if applicable)

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   - If using Prisma migrations, they will run automatically on deployment
   - Monitor the deployment logs for migration status
   - Ensure all tables and indexes are created successfully

2. **Seed Data (if required)**
   - Initial configuration data will be loaded automatically
   - Business rules and default settings will be applied
   - User roles and permissions will be established

### Step 9: Configure Custom Domain

#### Option 1: Use Railway Subdomain (Recommended for Testing)

2. **DNS Configuration**
   - Railway will provide DNS configuration instructions
   - Add the required CNAME or A records to your DNS provider
   - Typical configuration:
     ```
     Type: CNAME
     Name: sentiadeploy
     Value: your-app-name.railway.app
     TTL: 300
     ```

3. **SSL Certificate Setup**
   - Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates
   - Certificate provisioning may take 5-15 minutes
