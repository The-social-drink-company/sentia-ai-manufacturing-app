# Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard - Spec-Kit Master Document
## Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Implementation

This document serves as the master specification for reorganizing the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard using GitHub's Spec-Kit methodology. It addresses critical issues including Clerk authentication failures, AI/context drift, and code quality degradation.

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard
**Version**: 1.0.7
**Architecture**: Full-Stack Node.js with AI Integration
**Methodology**: Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using GitHub Spec-Kit

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Clerk Authentication Blank Screen Issue
- **Problem**: Users experience blank screens after authentication
- **Root Cause**: Middleware ordering, environment variable loading, CORS configuration
- **Impact**: Complete application failure for authenticated users

### 2. AI Drift and Context Drift
- **Problem**: AI assistants lose context and make incorrect assumptions
- **Root Cause**: Lack of structured specifications and guardrails
- **Impact**: Good code gets overwritten with inferior implementations

### 3. Code Quality Degradation
- **Problem**: Progressive deterioration of code quality over iterations
- **Root Cause**: No validation checkpoints or quality gates
- **Impact**: Technical debt accumulation and maintenance burden

## Spec-Kit Four-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: SPECIFY - What We're Building and Why
- User journey mapping
- Business objectives
- Success metrics
- User personas and use cases

### Phase 2: PLAN - Technical Architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- Architectural patterns
- Data models
- Integration requirements

### Phase 3: TASKS - Breakdown and Prioritization
- Small, testable units
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependency mapping
- Validation checkpoints

### Phase 4: IMPLEMENT - Controlled Execution
- Individual task implementation
- Review and validation
- Test-driven development
- Quality gates

## Document Structure

   - `user-requirements.md` - User stories and requirements
   - `business-logic.md` - Business rules and workflows
   - `api-contracts.md` - API specifications
   - `data-models.md` - Database schemas

2. **plan/** - Technical planning
   - `architecture.md` - System architecture
   - `tech-stack.md` - Technology decisions
   - `deployment.md` - Deployment strategy
   - `security.md` - Security requirements

3. **tasks/** - Implementation tasks

   - `feature-tasks.md` - New features
   - `refactoring.md` - Code improvements
   - `testing.md` - Test requirements

4. **validation/** - Quality assurance
   - `test-cases.md` - Test specifications
   - `acceptance-criteria.md` - Success criteria
   - `performance-metrics.md` - Performance targets
   - `security-checks.md` - Security validation

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate** (Week 1)
   - Fix Clerk authentication issue
   - Stabilize production deployment
   - Document current state

2. **Short-term** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Implement spec-driven workflow
   - Create comprehensive specifications
   - Establish quality gates

3. **Long-term** (Weeks 4-6)
   - Complete refactoring
   - Full test coverage
   - Production optimization

## Success Criteria

1. **Authentication**: 100% success rate for user login
2. **Code Quality**: Zero regression in implemented features
3. **AI Accuracy**: 95% correct implementations on first attempt
4. **Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
5. **Performance**: <2s page load times

## Guard Rails Against AI/Context Drift

1. **Explicit Specifications**: Every feature has detailed specs
2. **Validation Checkpoints**: Review before implementation
3. **Test-First Development**: Tests written before code
4. **Incremental Changes**: Small, reviewable chunks
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintain specification history

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed specifications for each component
2. Document technical plan with constraints
3. Break down into implementable tasks
4. Establish validation criteria
5. Begin systematic implementation
