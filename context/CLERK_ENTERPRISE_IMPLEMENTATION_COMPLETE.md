- **Files Updated**: All environment files in `config/environments/`

### 2. Enterprise Features Enabled
- Organization management for multi-tenant support
- Multi-domain configuration
- Custom authentication pages
- Webhook integration for real-time events
- Analytics and audit logging
- Production-grade security settings

### 3. Middleware Enhanced
- Robust key fallback system
- Enterprise feature integration
- Improved error handling
- Development debug support

### 4. Security Hardened
- Forced Clerk authentication (no JWT fallbacks)
- Auth bypass disabled
- Enterprise security features active
- Webhook security configured

## üöÄ Current Status

### Production Ready
- ‚úÖ All environment variables configured with production keys
- ‚úÖ Enterprise features enabled across all environments

- ‚úÖ Health endpoint should now work (fixing the 500 errors)

### Enterprise Features Active
- ‚úÖ Organization management
- ‚úÖ Multi-domain support
- ‚úÖ Custom authentication UI
- ‚úÖ Real-time webhooks
