# üéØ Render Management - Final Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### What We've Accomplished
1. **API Key Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - New key: `rnd_0jchuGfcyltSaCa7AxNj5wDF7XOO`
   - Stored securely as environment variable
   - All scripts updated

2. **PowerShell Management Scripts** ‚úÖ
   - `quick-status.ps1` - Check all services
   - `get-logs.ps1` - View service logs
   - `setup-environment.ps1` - Configure environment

3. **Security Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - API key rotation scheduled (March 2025)
   - Environment variables used
   - No hardcoded credentials

4. **MCP Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - Claude config file fixed
   - JSON syntax corrected
   - Ready if MCP becomes available

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Workflows

### Morning Health Check
```powershell
# Run complete status check
.\quick-status.ps1

# Check specific service if needed
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services" -Headers $headers
```

### Investigating Issues
```powershell
# Get recent logs
.\get-logs.ps1 -ServiceName "sentia-manufacturing-production" -Lines 100

# Check service details
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
$services = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services" -Headers $headers
$services | Where-Object {$_.service.name -eq "sentia-manufacturing-production"}
```

### Monitoring Deployments
```powershell
# Check deployment status via dashboard
Start-Process "https://dashboard.render.com/web/services"

# Or use API
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services/deployments" -Headers $headers
```

---

## üìà Advanced Operations

### Create Custom Monitoring
```powershell
# Save this as monitor-continuous.ps1
while ($true) {
    Clear-Host
    Write-Host "Render Services Monitor - $(Get-Date)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    .\quick-status.ps1
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 60
}
```

### Automated Health Reports
```powershell
# Save this as daily-report.ps1
$report = @{
    Date = Get-Date
    Services = @()
}

$services = @(
    "https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/health",
    "https://sentia-manufacturing-testing.onrender.com/health",
    "https://mcp-server-tkyu.onrender.com/health"
)

foreach ($url in $services) {
    try {
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -TimeoutSec 5
        $report.Services += @{URL = $url; Status = "Healthy"}
    } catch {
        $report.Services += @{URL = $url; Status = "Unhealthy"}
    }
}

$report | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "render-health-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').json"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Unauthorized" error | Run `.\setup-environment.ps1` to set API key |
| Service not found | Check service name spelling |
| Timeout errors | Check internet connection |
| No logs returned | Service may not have recent activity |

### Quick Diagnostics
```powershell
# Test API key
$env:RENDER_API_KEY
# Should show: rnd_0jchuGfcyltSaCa7AxNj5wDF7XOO

# Test API connection
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services?limit=1" -Headers $headers
# Should return at least one service
```
