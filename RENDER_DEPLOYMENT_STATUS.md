# RENDER DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**Date**: 2025-10-24 09:55 UTC
**Status**: Prisma postinstall now reads prisma.config.js; external Render health awaits fresh validation because network access is restricted in this session.

## Current Snapshot (last fully verified 2025-10-21 08:37 UTC)

| Service  | Deploy Status        | Health Check Reference             | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Frontend | Pending verification | https://app.capliquify.com (200 on 2025-10-21 08:36Z) | Requires Clerk environment variables; recheck once external access allowed. |
| Backend  | Pending verification | https://api.capliquify.com/api/health (200 on 2025-10-21 08:36Z) | prisma.config.js resolves previous missing @prisma/cli error; rerun the /api/health endpoint externally. |
| MCP      | Pending verification | https://mcp.capliquify.com/health (200 on 2025-10-21 08:36Z) | Uptime previously healthy; no new telemetry captured locally. |

---

## Verification Evidence

- Pending this session: network access restricted, unable to rerun curl/Invoke-WebRequest or scripts/check-render-deployment.js.
- Historical confirmation (2025-10-21 08:36-08:58 UTC) retained for reference: app, api, and MCP endpoints returned 200 with healthy payloads.
- pnpm exec prisma generate succeeds locally using prisma.config.js with defineConfig from prisma/config; Render build logs should mirror this behaviour.

---

## Outstanding Follow-ups

1. Patch scripts/check-render-deployment.js so automated monitoring works once network checks resume.
2. Run pnpm approve-builds on Render to allow Prisma and Clerk scripts during install.
3. Confirm Clerk key provisioning before redeploying authenticated frontend flows.
4. Re-run external health verification and update this document with fresh timestamps.
5. Rotate newly supplied Render API key (rnd_o***XTsNAqM) after the external checks; store only via Render secrets manager or CI vault.

## Historical Log

- 2025-10-20 snapshot retained below for context; superseded by the 2025-10-21 healthy verification pending the new check.

## 2025-10-21 07:45 UTC Failure Snapshot
- Service: capliquify-backend-prod (srv-d3p77vripnbc739pc2n0) on Render (Oregon, Starter)
- Build command: corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm exec prisma generate
- Failure: pnpm skipped build scripts for @clerk/shared, @prisma/client, @prisma/engines, core-js, esbuild, msgpackr-extract, prisma; postinstall `prisma generate` crashed loading @prisma/cli from prisma.config.ts.
- Checked out commit: f6e39c3c9f45fdffd97daf67fa5ed9d30997372f (missing newly added `.npmrc` allow-scripts and updated prisma.config.ts).
- Required fix: push new commit with `import { defineConfig } from 'prisma/config'` and `.npmrc` allow-scripts policy, then redeploy with cache clear so pnpm runs whitelisted scripts.
## 2025-10-21 Frontend Deployment Check (09:00 UTC)
- Service: capliquify-frontend-prod (srv-d3p789umcj7s739rfnf0) on Render Static Site (main branch).
- Build command: corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build; publish directory: dist.
- Latest automated deploy pulled commit f6e39c3c (same as backend) before prisma config + allow-scripts fixes landed.
- Status: Last verified HTTP 200 response on 2025-10-21 08:36 UTC, but current build artifact predates fixes; Clerk keys still pending verification.
- Action: After backend fixes push, trigger manual redeploy (clear cache) for static site, confirm clerk-enabled routes load, update deployment status.
## 2025-10-21 08:26 UTC Backend Build Warning
- Render pulled commit 0091c5c1af6dbd73037a16ed2cdc2ae291ef3f4a (docs(bmad)â€¦ refresh). Build again hit pnpm build-script gate; skipped @clerk/shared, @prisma/client, @prisma/engines, core-js, esbuild, msgpackr-extract, prisma.
- Postinstall still runs `pnpm exec prisma generate`; success depends on cached engines from previous builds, but skipped scripts risk missing binaries.
- Action: ensure `.npmrc` with allow-scripts is committed in this commit and rerun build with cache cleared; otherwise rerun `pnpm approve-builds` on Render to whitelist packages.
- 09:55 UTC: Restored package.json and ran pnpm install locally; Prisma client regenerates via prisma.config.js. Pending push + cache clear to unblock Render.
- New Render API key [Render API key redacted - rotate after deploy] received; record in secrets manager and rotate after redeploy.
