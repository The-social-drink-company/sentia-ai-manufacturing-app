## üéØ Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Production Issue
```
1. "Show status of all production services"
2. "Get error logs from production in the last 30 minutes"
3. "Check CPU and memory usage for production"
4. "Show recent deployment history"
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Investigation
```
1. "Show response times for all endpoints"
2. "Display CPU usage trends over the last 6 hours"
3. "Check database query performance"
4. "List slow API endpoints"
```

### Scenario 3: Deployment Verification
```
1. "Show the latest deployment status"
2. "Check if all health endpoints are responding"
3. "Compare error rates before and after deployment"
4. "Verify all services are running the latest version"
```

---

## üèÉ Quick Health Check Routine

Run these commands in sequence for a complete health check:

```
1. List all services and their status
2. Check production service health
3. Show any errors in the last hour
4. Display current resource usage
5. Verify database connections are healthy
```

## üìã Daily Operations Checklist

### Morning Check (9:00 AM)
```
‚ñ° "Show overnight error summary"
‚ñ° "Check all service health status"
‚ñ° "Display resource usage trends"
‚ñ° "List any failed deployments"
```

### Midday Check (1:00 PM)
```
‚ñ° "Show current traffic levels"
‚ñ° "Check API response times"
‚ñ° "Verify database performance"
‚ñ° "Review any warning logs"
```

### End of Day (5:00 PM)
```
‚ñ° "Summary of today's deployments"
‚ñ° "Check for any pending issues"
‚ñ° "Resource usage for capacity planning"
‚ñ° "Set up any needed alerts"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use natural language** - The MCP understands context
   - ‚úÖ "Is production healthy?"
   - ‚úÖ "Why is the API slow?"
   - ‚úÖ "What changed recently?"

2. **Be specific when needed**
   - "Show errors from sentia-manufacturing-production between 2pm and 3pm"
   - "Get logs containing 'timeout' from the last 2 hours"

3. **Combine queries**
   - "Check production health and show any errors if unhealthy"
   - "List services and highlight any with high CPU usage"

4. **Save useful queries**
   - Document queries that solve specific problems
   - Create templates for common investigations

## üö® Emergency Commands

### Critical Incident Response
```
IMMEDIATE: "Show all critical errors across all services"
DIAGNOSE: "Get detailed logs for [service] for the last hour"
METRICS: "Show all performance metrics for [service]"
HISTORY: "What deployments happened in the last 4 hours?"
ROLLBACK: "Show me how to rollback to the previous version"
```
