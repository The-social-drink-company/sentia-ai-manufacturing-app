# üö® CRITICAL: Render Environment Variables Update Required

## Current Status
- **Production**: 502 Error - Missing critical environment variables
- **Development**: 200 OK but missing authentication keys
- **Git Push**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Simplified server deployed

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### üìç Navigate to Render Dashboard
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

---

## üî¥ PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT (Priority 1)

**Service**: `sentia-manufacturing-production`

### Step 1: Navigate to Environment Tab
1. Click on `sentia-manufacturing-production` service
2. Go to `Environment` tab

### Step 2: Add Missing Critical Variables
**Copy and paste these exactly:**

```env
# CRITICAL - Authentication (Missing)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_REDACTED
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_REDACTED
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_REDACTED
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_REDACTED

# CRITICAL - API Configuration (Missing)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/api
API_BASE_URL=https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/api

# CRITICAL - Clerk URLs (Missing)
VITE_CLERK_DOMAIN=clerk.financeflo.ai
VITE_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
VITE_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
VITE_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
VITE_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_REDACTED

# MCP Server Integration (Missing)
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://mcp-server-tkyu.onrender.com
VITE_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://mcp-server-tkyu.onrender.com
MCP_JWT_SECRET=production-mcp-jwt-secret-2025

# Security (Missing)
SESSION_SECRET=production-session-secret-2025-sentia
JWT_SECRET=production-jwt-secret-2025-sentia
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

### Step 3: Save and Deploy
1. Click **"Save Changes"**
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

---

## üü° DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (Priority 2)

**Service**: `sentia-manufacturing-development`

### Repeat Same Process
1. Navigate to `sentia-manufacturing-development` service
2. Go to `Environment` tab
3. Add the SAME variables but with development URLs:

```env
# Change these URLs for development:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/api
API_BASE_URL=https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/api
CORS_ORIGINS=https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com

# Keep all other variables the same as production
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### After 5 minutes, test:

1. **Production Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Expected: JSON response with "status": "healthy"

2. **Production Main Site**
   - Visit: https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com
   - Should see: Login page or dashboard

3. **Development Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Expected: JSON response

4. **Development Main Site**
   - Visit: https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com
   - Should see: Application loads without stuck loading screen

## üéØ What This Fixes

### Production (502 Error)
- ‚úÖ Simplified server is deployed (git push completed)
- ‚ùå Missing Clerk keys preventing authentication
- ‚ùå Missing API configuration causing server errors
- **Solution**: Adding environment variables enables the simplified server to start correctly

### Development (Loading Screen)
- ‚úÖ Server is running (200 OK)
- ‚ùå React context error from missing VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- ‚ùå Authentication system not initialized
- **Solution**: Adding Clerk keys fixes React initialization

---

## üìä Expected Timeline

1. **0-2 minutes**: Add variables to Render
2. **2-5 minutes**: Automatic redeployment
3. **5-7 minutes**: Services fully operational
4. **7+ minutes**: Both environments working

---

## üöÄ Why This Will Work

The simplified production server (`production-server-simple.js`) is already deployed via Git. It's designed to:
- Start quickly (within Render's timeout)
- Use minimal environment variables
- Serve static files efficiently
- Handle basic authentication

The ONLY missing piece is the environment variables, especially:
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (for frontend)
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (for backend)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (for API routing)

Once these are added, both environments will be fully functional!

---

## üÜò If Issues Persist

1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Go to service ‚Üí Logs tab
   - Look for startup errors

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **Manual Redeploy**:
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"

---

## üìù Notes

- The Git push has been completed successfully
- The simplified server is deployed
- Only environment variables are missing
- This is a one-time configuration
- Future deployments will work automatically
