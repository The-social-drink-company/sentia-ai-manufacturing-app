   - Railway will auto-detect the configuration

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - You mentioned all environment variables are already added
   - Verify they're applied to the new service
   - Check that sensitive values are properly set

#### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Automatic)

1. **Connect Repository**
   - In Railway dashboard, connect the GitHub repository
   - Enable automatic deployments on push to `development` branch
