# ðŸš¨ URGENT: RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
Render is STILL running `node server-render.js` even though we updated all configs to use `node server.js`.
This is a **caching issue** - Render hasn't picked up the configuration changes.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Option 1: Clear Cache in Render Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your service: `sentia-manufacturing-development`
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Scroll to **"Build & Deploy"** section
5. Click **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
6. Wait for new deployment

### Option 2: Manual Override Start Command
1. In Render Dashboard â†’ your service
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Find **"Start Command"** field
4. It probably shows: `node server-render.js`
5. **CHANGE IT TO**: `node server.js`
6. Click **"Save Changes"**
7. Service will auto-redeploy

### Option 3: Force New Deployment
```bash
# Make sure changes are pushed
git add -A
git commit -m "Force Render to use server.js - clear cache required"
git push origin development

# Then in Render Dashboard:
# Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ Check "Clear build cache" â†’ Deploy
```

### Option 4: Environment Variable Override
If above doesn't work, add this environment variable in Render:
- Key: `START_COMMAND`
- Value: `node server.js`

## What's Happening?
- Your logs show: `Running 'node server-render.js'`
- But render.yaml says: `startCommand: node server.js`
- This means Render is using OLD cached configuration

## Verification After Fix
Once redeployed, logs should show:
```
==> Running 'node server.js'  # NOT server-render.js
Server started on port 3000
Database connected successfully
```

## Why This Will Work
- `server.js` has NO import for userRoutes.js
- `server-render.js` has the problematic import
- We need Render to use the correct file

## If Still Not Working
Last resort - Delete and recreate the service:
1. Note down all environment variables
2. Delete the service in Render
3. Create new service from same repo
4. It will use the correct render.yaml

**YOUR DEPLOYMENT WILL WORK ONCE RENDER USES THE CORRECT START COMMAND!**
