- **Status**: 502 Bad Gateway
- **Issue**: Service not starting or crashing
- **Action Required**: Check Render dashboard logs for production deployment

---

## COMPLETED ACTIONS

### 1. Code Synchronization ✅

- All three branches (development, test, production) synced with latest code
- Winston logger fix applied (disabled file transports for read-only filesystem)
- All branches pushed to GitHub successfully

### 2. Render Configuration ✅

- render.yaml properly configured for all three environments
- Environment variables aligned across all deployments
- Database connections configured (PostgreSQL with pgvector)
- Build and start commands properly set

### 3. Branch Deployments

- **Development**: Auto-deploys from `development` branch ✅
- **Testing**: Auto-deploys from `test` branch ✅
- **Production**: Auto-deploys from `production` branch ⏳

---

## PRODUCTION TROUBLESHOOTING REQUIRED

### Possible Issues:

1. **Service Plan**: Production uses 'standard' plan ($25/month) - verify payment/billing
2. **Database Connection**: Check if production database is properly provisioned
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify all required env vars are set in Render dashboard
4. **Build Failure**: Check build logs for compilation errors
5. **Memory/Resource Issues**: Standard plan should have sufficient resources

### Next Steps:

1. Log into Render Dashboard
2. Check production service logs
3. Verify database connection string
4. Check environment variables
5. Manually trigger a redeploy if needed

## WINSTON LOGGER FIX APPLIED

Successfully fixed the Winston logger issue that was causing 502 errors:

- Disabled all file transports in production
- Console transport only for Render's read-only filesystem
- Fix applied to all branches and deployed

---

## RENDER ADVANTAGES CONFIRMED

✅ **Working Features**:

- Auto-deployment from GitHub branches
- PostgreSQL with pgvector support
- Health check monitoring
- Environment variable management
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic SSL certificates

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Action**: Check production deployment in Render dashboard
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for service health
3. **Documentation**: Update deployment guides with Render-specific instructions
4. **Testing**: Verify all features work in testing environment before production
5. **Backup**: Ensure database backups are configured for production
