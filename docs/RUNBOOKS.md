## Emergency Procedures

### ðŸš¨ System Down - Critical Outage

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**
1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   ```bash
   # Check system health
   curl -f https://sentia-manufacturing.com/health
   
   # Check Railway services
   railway status --environment production
   ```

2. **Assess impact**
   - Check error rates in monitoring dashboard
   - Verify if database is accessible
   - Check external API dependencies

3. **Emergency rollback if needed**
   ```bash
   # Get last known good deployment
   railway deployments --limit 5
   
   # Rollback to previous version
   railway rollback [DEPLOYMENT_ID]
   ```

**Communication (Within 10 minutes):**
```bash
# Notify team via Slack
curl -X POST $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL -d '{
  "text": "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Production system outage detected",
  "attachments": [{
    "color": "danger",
    "fields": [
      {"title": "Status", "value": "Investigating", "short": true},
      {"title": "ETA", "value": "TBD", "short": true}
    ]
  }]
}'
```

### ðŸ”¥ High Error Rate Alert

**Investigation Steps:**
1. **Check recent deployments**
   ```bash
   # Review last 3 deployments
   railway deployments --limit 3
   
   # Check deployment logs
   railway logs --deployment [DEPLOYMENT_ID]
   ```

2. **Analyze error patterns**
   ```bash
   # Check application logs
   railway logs --filter "ERROR" --tail 100
   
   # Review Sentry dashboard for error trends
   open https://sentry.io/organizations/sentia/issues/
   ```

3. **Database health check**
   ```bash
   # Check database connections
   railway connect postgres
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
   
   # Check slow queries
   SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time 
   FROM pg_stat_statements 
   ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Resolution Actions:**
- If recent deployment caused issues: Rollback
- If database issues: Scale up or optimize queries
- If external API issues: Enable circuit breaker

## Performance Troubleshooting

### High CPU Usage

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# Check process usage in Railway logs
railway logs --filter "CPU" --tail 100

# Review slow endpoints
curl -s https://sentia-manufacturing.com/api/metrics/slow-queries

# Check for infinite loops or heavy operations
railway exec -- top -p $(pgrep node)
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**
- **Heavy computations**: Move to background jobs
- **Inefficient algorithms**: Profile and optimize code
- **Memory leaks**: Check for unclosed connections/listeners
- **High traffic**: Scale horizontally

### Database Performance Issues

**Slow Query Analysis:**
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Check for missing indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND n_distinct > 100
AND correlation < 0.1;

-- Monitor active connections
SELECT count(*), state
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY state;
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
```bash
# Enable connection pooling
# Add to DATABASE_URL: ?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=10

# Optimize queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
railway connect postgres
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';

# Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
```

### Memory Issues

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check memory usage patterns
railway logs --filter "memory" --tail 200

# Monitor heap usage
curl -s https://sentia-manufacturing.com/api/metrics/memory
```

**Common Solutions:**
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Fix memory leaks (unclosed DB connections, event listeners)
- Optimize large data processing
- Increase memory limits if needed

## Database Operations

### Backup Procedures

**Automated Daily Backups:**
```bash
# Verify backup schedule
railway variables get BACKUP_SCHEDULE
# Should be: "0 2 * * *" (daily at 2 AM)

# Manual backup
railway exec -- pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp backup_*.sql s3://sentia-backups/database/
```

**Backup Verification:**
```bash
# Test backup integrity
railway exec -- pg_restore --list backup_latest.sql

# Verify backup size and date
aws s3 ls s3://sentia-backups/database/ --recursive --human-readable
```

### Database Maintenance

**Weekly Tasks:**
```sql
-- Update table statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Rebuild indexes if needed
REINDEX DATABASE sentia_production;

-- Clean up old data (if applicable)
DELETE FROM audit_logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

**Monthly Tasks:**
```sql
-- Vacuum full (schedule during low-traffic)
VACUUM FULL;

-- Update extensions
-- (Coordinate with Railway support)
```

### Data Recovery

**Point-in-Time Recovery:**
```bash
# Create new database from backup
railway database create --from-backup [BACKUP_ID]

# Switch application to use recovery database
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=[RECOVERY_URL]

# Deploy with new database URL
railway deploy
```

---

## Security Incidents

### Suspected Security Breach

**Immediate Actions (0-10 minutes):**
1. **Do NOT shut down systems** (preserve evidence)
2. **Change all service passwords/tokens**
   ```bash
   # Rotate Clerk keys
   # Rotate database passwords
   # Rotate API keys
   railway variables set CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[NEW_KEY]
   ```
3. **Enable enhanced logging**
4. **Block suspicious IPs** (if identified)

**Investigation (10-60 minutes):**
```bash
# Review access logs
railway logs --filter "unauthorized\|failed\|blocked" --tail 1000

# Check for unusual patterns
grep -E "(sql injection|xss|rce)" logs/security.log

# Review user account activities
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action IN ('login', 'password_change', 'privilege_escalation')
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Containment:**
- Isolate affected systems
- Revoke compromised credentials
