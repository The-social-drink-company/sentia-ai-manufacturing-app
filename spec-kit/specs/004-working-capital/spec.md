## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a Finance Controller, I need comprehensive working capital visibility to optimize cash flow, manage AR/AP aging, and maintain healthy inventory levels, enabling data-driven decisions that improve liquidity and operational efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** finance role, **When** accessing working capital dashboard, **Then** I see current cash position, DSO, DPO, and inventory turnover metrics
2. **Given** AR aging data, **When** viewing receivables, **Then** I see aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+) with customer details
3. **Given** AP data, **When** analyzing payables, **Then** I can prioritize payments based on terms and cash availability
4. **Given** historical data, **When** using forecast tool, **Then** I see 13-week cash flow projection with confidence bands
5. **Given** inventory levels, **When** reviewing turnover, **Then** I see slow-moving stock alerts and optimization opportunities

### Edge Cases
