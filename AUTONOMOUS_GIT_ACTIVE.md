# 🤖 Autonomous Git Agent - ACTIVE & READY

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025
**Version**: 1.0

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

The autonomous git agent system is **ACTIVE** and managing all git operations automatically. You don't need to do anything - just code normally and the system handles commits, pushes, and PRs for you!

---

## 📊 Current Session Status

**Branch**: `development` ✅
**System**: All triggers active ✅
**Last Push**: `267aaf3c..63b252f0` (5 commits)
**Commits This Session**: 10 total
**Pushes This Session**: 2 successful
**Next Push**: After 5 more commits (or 1 hour)

---

## ✅ What The System Does Automatically

### 1. **Auto-Commits** (No Action Required)

The system automatically creates commits when:

- ✅ **You complete a TodoWrite task** (PRIMARY trigger)
  - Most reliable signal
  - Uses your task description as commit message
  - Commits immediately after marking complete

- ✅ **5+ files are changed** (SECONDARY trigger)
  - OR 150+ lines modified
  - OR 3+ new files created
  - Catches substantial progress

- ✅ **30 minutes pass** with uncommitted work (TERTIARY trigger)
  - Safety checkpoint (WIP commit)
  - Prevents work loss
  - Can be squashed later

### 2. **Auto-Pushes** (No Action Required)

The system automatically pushes to `development` when:

- ✅ **5 commits accumulated** (count-based)
- ✅ **OR 1 hour passes** with unpushed commits (time-based)
- ✅ **Whichever comes first**

Result: Your code is always backed up to GitHub!

### 3. **PR Suggestions** (Asks First)

The system will **suggest** creating a PR when:

- Feature/epic is complete
- Significant milestone reached
- Multiple commits ready for review

But it **always asks before creating** - you stay in control!

---

## 🎯 Commit Message Examples

The system generates professional commit messages automatically:

```

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore

## 🔒 Safety Rules (Always Enforced)

The system has rock-solid safety constraints:

- ❌ **NEVER** commits to `test` branch (without explicit instruction)
- ❌ **NEVER** commits to `production` branch (without explicit instruction)
- ❌ **NEVER** creates PRs without asking first
- ❌ **NEVER** pushes if merge conflicts exist
- ✅ **ONLY** operates on `development` branch automatically

**You are protected from accidents!**

## 🎮 How To Use

### For Regular Development

**Do**: Just code normally

- Work on your features
- Use TodoWrite to track tasks
- Mark tasks complete when done
- The system handles the rest!

**Don't**: Worry about git operations

- ~~Manual commits~~
- ~~Crafting messages~~
- ~~Remembering to push~~
- ~~Git workflow management~~

### Example Session

```
You: Start working on a feature
You: Create TodoWrite tasks
You: Mark first task complete → 🤖 AUTO-COMMIT #1
You: Mark second task complete → 🤖 AUTO-COMMIT #2
You: Continue working...
You: Mark fifth task complete → 🤖 AUTO-COMMIT #5
System: 🚀 AUTO-PUSH (5 commits)
You: Continue coding...
System: "Feature complete (12 commits). Create PR?"
You: Approve → PR created ✅
```

**You just coded. The system did everything else!**

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Settings (Default)

```javascript
{
  "triggers": {
    "taskCompletion": true,      // ✅ Task-based commits
    "significantChanges": true,   // ✅ Change-based commits
    "timeBased": true,            // ✅ Safety checkpoints
    "timeThresholdMinutes": 30
  },
  "changeThresholds": {
    "files": 5,                   // 5+ files trigger
    "lines": 150,                 // 150+ lines trigger
    "newFiles": 3                 // 3+ new files trigger
  },
  "pushStrategy": {
    "commitCount": 5,             // Push every 5 commits
