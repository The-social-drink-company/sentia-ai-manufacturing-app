# Feature Specification: Inventory Management System

**Feature Branch**: `005-inventory-management`
**Created**: September 26, 2025
**Status**: Active
**Input**: Comprehensive inventory management system for tracking stock levels, optimizing reorder points, monitoring supplier performance, and providing predictive analytics for inventory optimization

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Authenticate user and verify inventory access permissions
   ’ If insufficient permissions: Show read-only view
2. Load inventory dashboard with real-time stock levels
   ’ Fetch current inventory positions
   ’ Load pending orders and receipts
   ’ Calculate inventory metrics (turnover, days on hand)
3. Display inventory analytics
   ’ Stock level monitoring with alerts
   ’ ABC analysis classification
   ’ Slow-moving inventory identification
   ’ Supplier performance tracking
4. Process reorder point calculations
   ’ Analyze demand patterns
   ’ Calculate optimal reorder quantities
   ’ Factor in lead times and safety stock
5. Generate predictive forecasts
   ’ Demand forecasting based on historical data
   ’ Seasonal trend analysis
   ’ Stockout risk assessment
6. Provide optimization recommendations
   ’ Inventory reduction opportunities
   ’ Supplier consolidation suggestions
   ’ Cost optimization strategies
7. Enable inventory transactions
   ’ Stock adjustments and transfers
   ’ Cycle count management
   ’ Barcode/QR code integration
8. Return: SUCCESS (inventory dashboard loaded with actionable insights)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an Inventory Manager, I need comprehensive visibility into stock levels, demand patterns, and supplier performance to optimize inventory costs while maintaining service levels and preventing stockouts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an inventory user accesses the dashboard, **When** they load the inventory page, **Then** they see current stock levels for all SKUs within 3 seconds
2. **Given** stock levels exist, **When** viewing inventory analytics, **Then** they see ABC classification, turnover ratios, and days on hand metrics
3. **Given** reorder points are configured, **When** stock falls below threshold, **Then** system generates automated alerts and purchase requisitions
4. **Given** historical demand data, **When** requesting forecasts, **Then** system provides 30/60/90-day demand predictions with confidence intervals
5. **Given** slow-moving inventory exists, **When** analyzing optimization opportunities, **Then** system identifies items for liquidation or promotion
6. **Given** barcode scanning capability, **When** performing cycle counts, **Then** system updates inventory quantities in real-time
7. **Given** supplier performance data, **When** evaluating suppliers, **Then** system shows lead time accuracy, quality metrics, and cost comparisons

### Edge Cases
- What happens when demand patterns change suddenly? ’ System detects anomalies and adjusts forecasts with confidence level indicators
- How does system handle stockouts? ’ Automatic alerts to procurement with suggested expedited orders and alternative suppliers
- What if supplier lead times extend? ’ Dynamic reorder point adjustments with risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- How to handle seasonal inventory? ’ Seasonal forecasting models with pre-season build-up recommendations

## Requirements
