# Deploy to Production Environment

Deploy tested changes to the live production environment.

## üî¥ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - MAXIMUM CAUTION

**This command deploys to the LIVE PRODUCTION environment.**

According to CLAUDE.md deployment rules:
- Production deployments require explicit user instruction
- Must have passed UAT in test environment
- Requires stakeholder approval
- Follow enterprise quality gates

## Pre-Production Verification

### 1. Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Changes successfully deployed to test environment
- [ ] UAT completed and approved by stakeholders
- [ ] All critical issues resolved
- [ ] No known bugs in test environment
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained

### 2. User Confirmation Required

Ask the user to confirm EACH of these:
1. "Has UAT been completed successfully in the test environment?"
2. "Have stakeholders approved this production deployment?"
3. "Are you authorized to deploy to production?"
4. "Have you taken a backup of production data (if applicable)?"
5. "Type 'DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION' to confirm"

**DO NOT PROCEED** unless ALL confirmations are received.

## Deployment Process

Once all confirmations received:

1. **Create Release Tag**
   ```bash
   # Create semantic version tag
   git tag -a v[version] -m "Production release [version]"
   ```

2. **Merge Test to Production**
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git pull origin production
   git merge test
   ```

3. **Push to Production**
   ```bash
   git push origin production
   git push origin v[version]
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Watch Render dashboard closely
   - Monitor application logs
   - Check for errors

## Deployment Monitoring

Watch for:
- Build completion (3-5 minutes)
- Application startup
- Health check response
- No error logs

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin production
```

Or contact Render support to rollback to previous deployment.

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Critical Checks (Execute Immediately)
1. ‚úÖ Application loads at production URL
2. ‚úÖ Health endpoint responds: /health
3. ‚úÖ Authentication works
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard displays correctly
5. ‚úÖ API endpoints functional
6. ‚úÖ No JavaScript console errors
7. ‚úÖ Database connections working
8. ‚úÖ External integrations operational (Xero, Shopify)

### Monitoring (First 30 Minutes)
- Watch Render logs for errors
- Monitor application performance
- Check error tracking (if configured)
- Verify user reports (if any)
