## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a C-level executive, I need to quickly assess the financial health of our manufacturing operations at a glance, identify areas requiring immediate attention, and drill down into specific metrics to make data-driven decisions about working capital optimization and cash flow management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated executive user, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see current financial KPIs within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a KPI is below threshold, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** the metric is highlighted with visual alerts
3. **Given** an executive viewing the dashboard, **When** they click on a KPI widget, **Then** they see detailed trend analysis over the past 12 months
4. **Given** multiple data sources are available, **When** data refreshes, **Then** all widgets update simultaneously without page reload
5. **Given** an executive needs to share insights, **When** they export the dashboard, **Then** they receive a PDF report with current metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external data sources are unavailable? → Display last known values with "stale data" indicator and timestamp
- How does system handle conflicting data from multiple sources? → Use primary source hierarchy with reconciliation alerts
- What if user has limited permissions? → Show only authorized metrics with clear indication of restricted access
- How to handle real-time updates during export? → Snapshot data at export time with timestamp
