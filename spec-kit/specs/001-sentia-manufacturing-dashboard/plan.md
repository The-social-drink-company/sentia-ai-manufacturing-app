# Implementation Plan: Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard

**Specification**: specs/001-sentia-manufacturing-dashboard/spec.md  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Implemented

## Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates

### Simplicity Gate (Article VII)

- [x] Using 3 projects? YES (Frontend, Backend, MCP Server)
- [x] No future-proofing? YES (Built for current requirements)

### Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VIII)

- [x] Using frameworks directly? YES (React, Express without heavy wrappers)
- [x] Single model representation? YES (Prisma ORM)

### Integration-First Gate (Article IX)

- [x] Contracts defined? YES (API endpoints documented)
- [x] Contract tests written? YES (E2E and integration tests)

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 4 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Authentication**: Clerk (production domain: clerk.financeflo.ai)
- **AI**: MCP Server with Claude 3.5, GPT-4, Gemini Pro
- **Deployment**: Railway with development, test, and production environments
- **Baseline Maintenance**: Repository re-cloned on 2025-09-25 to restore lint compliance

## Critical Implementation Lessons

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Problem**: Railway environment variables not loading

**Solution**: Explicit `railway.json` configuration with environment-specific variables

```json
{
  "environments": {
    "development": { "variables": { "NODE_ENV": "development" } },
    "test": { "variables": { "NODE_ENV": "test" } },
    "production": { "variables": { "NODE_ENV": "production" } }
  }
}
```

### 2. Navigation Implementation

**Problem**: Users could not navigate between features

**Solution**: Enterprise sidebar with keyboard shortcuts

```javascript
// src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx
const navigationItems = [
  { section: 'Overview', items: [{ to: '/dashboard', icon: HomeIcon }] },
  { section: 'Planning & Analytics', items: [...] },
  { section: 'Financial Management', items: [...] }
];
```

### 3. Performance Optimisation

**Problem**: Unnecessary re-renders caused lag

**Solution**: React memoisation and code splitting

```javascript
const Dashboard = memo(({ setCurrentView }) => {
  /* ... */
})
const Calculator = lazy(() => import('./Calculator'))
```

### 4. Security Hardening

**Problem**: Eight vulnerabilities detected

**Solution**: Updated dependencies and CSP headers

```javascript
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        'script-src': ["'self'", 'https://clerk.financeflo.ai'],
      },
    },
  })
)
```

### 5. Git Workflow Enforcement

**Problem**: Uncontrolled deployments to production

**Solution**: Enforced branch progression

```
development -> test -> production
Pull request required for each merge
Auto-deploy on branch push
```

## Complexity Tracking

### Justified Complexity

1. Three deployment environments required for enterprise UAT process.
2. Separate MCP server so AI workloads stay isolated from the main application.
3. Multiple LLM providers for redundancy and capability optimisation.

### Avoided Complexity

1. No custom container orchestration; Render manages build and runtime.
2. Clerk used instead of bespoke authentication.
3. Added Zustand only after state management needs were confirmed.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for components and utilities.
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions.
- End-to-end tests for user workflows with Playwright.
- Contract tests aligned with documented API specifications.

Execution order: contract tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, unit tests.

## Deployment Configuration

### Railway Setup

```yaml
services:
  - name: sentia-manufacturing-dashboard
    env: development|test|production
    buildCommand: pm run build
    startCommand: pm run start
    healthcheckPath: /health
```

### Environment Variables

```env
# Critical Production Variables
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_*
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_*
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://*
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://*.onrender.com/api
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance

- Build time under 12 seconds
- Bundle size under 2 MB
- Initial load under 3 seconds
- API response times under 200 ms

### Quality

- Zero console errors in production
- All navigation paths functional
- Real-time updates confirmed
- Security vulnerabilities remediated

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. Implement comprehensive error boundaries.
2. Add performance monitoring (Sentry).
3. Enhance mobile experience for operators.
4. Implement additional caching strategies.

### Technical Debt

1. Consolidate duplicate API clients.
2. Standardise error handling patterns.
3. Improve automated test coverage beyond 80%.
4. Formalise API contract documentation.
