### Step 2: Configure Claude Code (2 minutes)

**Find your config file:**

- **Windows**: Press `Win+R`, type: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
- **Mac**: Open Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+G`, type: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`

**Create/Edit**: `claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "render": {
      "url": "https://mcp.render.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace**: `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key

**Restart Claude Code**: Close completely and reopen

---

### Step 3: Test Your Connection (1 minute)

**In Claude Code, type:**

```
Using the Render MCP server, list all my services
```

**You should see:**
- sentia-manufacturing-production
- sentia-manufacturing-testing
- sentia-manufacturing-development
- sentia-mcp-server
- Databases (sentia-db-production, etc.)

**If it works**: ‚úÖ Proceed to Step 4
**If not**: Check troubleshooting below

---

### Step 4: Run Your First Real Query (2 minutes)

**Try these power queries:**

1. **Check Production Health**
   ```
   Show the health status of sentia-manufacturing-production
   ```

2. **View Recent Logs**
   ```
   Show me the last 10 log entries from production
   ```

3. **Check MCP Server**
   ```
   What's the status of the service at https://mcp-server-tkyu.onrender.com
   ```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" Error
1. Check config file location is correct
2. Verify JSON syntax (no trailing commas!)
3. Restart Claude Code completely

### "Authentication failed" Error
1. Check for spaces before/after API key
2. Ensure "Bearer " prefix in config
3. Verify key hasn't been revoked

### "No services found" Error
1. Check you're using the right Render account
2. Verify API key has access to your workspace
3. Try regenerating the key
