# Sentia to CapLiquify Renaming - Completion Report

Epic: EPIC-007 (CapLiquify Rebranding)
Created: 2025-10-19
Completed: 2025-10-20
Status: Complete (custom domain enhancement delivered)
BMAD Stories: BMAD-REBRAND-001 through BMAD-REBRAND-006 (BMAD-REBRAND-006 requires a short Clerk update)

---

## Executive Summary

- The Sentia to CapLiquify rebranding work is complete across infrastructure, code updates, and documentation.
- Render keeps service subdomains tied to their original names, so the team delivered production-grade custom domains instead of depending on `*.onrender.com` addresses.
- The production environment now serves the application from `app.capliquify.com`, with API and MCP traffic on dedicated subdomains, all fronted by Render-issued SSL certificates.

## Deliverables Compared to Plan

| Task | Original Plan | Actual Implementation | Status |
|------|---------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Render service naming | Rename to `capliquify-*-prod` | Services renamed as planned | Complete |
| Render subdomain URLs | Auto-update to match new names | Subdomains remain `sentia-*.onrender.com` | Discovery |
| Custom domains | Not in scope | `app/api/mcp.capliquify.com` implemented | Complete |
| CORS configuration | Update allowed origins | Custom and legacy domains added | Complete |
| Environment templates | Refresh with new URLs | All `.env` templates updated | Complete |
| Clerk configuration | Add new domains | Pending user action | Open |
| Documentation | Update references | Comprehensive guides produced | Complete |

## Key Finding: Render Subdomains Do Not Change

- Renaming a Render service updates the service name only; the autogenerated subdomain remains bound to the original value.
- This behavior is intentional and preserves existing traffic. Relying on the old subdomain would have left Sentia references in production URLs.
- Implementing custom domains provided a cleaner brand experience, stable URLs, and free managed SSL from Render.

### Production Stack Summary

Custom domains:
- Frontend: https://app.capliquify.com (SSL active)
- API: https://api.capliquify.com (SSL active)
- MCP: https://mcp.capliquify.com (SSL active)
- Database: Internal Render PostgreSQL (no public DNS)

Legacy subdomains retained for compatibility:
- https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com
- https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com
- https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com

## Implementation Details

### Render Service Configuration

| Service | Render Name | Custom Domain | SSL | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----|--------|
| Frontend | `capliquify-frontend-prod` | `app.capliquify.com` | Issued | Serving traffic |
| Backend | `capliquify-backend-prod` | `api.capliquify.com` | Issued | Serving traffic |
| MCP | `capliquify-mcp-prod` | `mcp.capliquify.com` | Issued | Serving traffic |
| Database | `capliquify-db-prod` | Internal only | N/A | Connected |

DNS configuration:
```
app.capliquify.com -> CNAME -> sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com
api.capliquify.com -> CNAME -> sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com
mcp.capliquify.com -> CNAME -> sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com
```

### Code Updates

- `server.js`: refreshed CORS rules, branding strings, and service names for health checks and WebSocket messaging.
- `.env.template`, `.env.production.template`, `.env.development.template`: aligned product naming, domains, and database references with CapLiquify.
- `render.yaml`: confirmed service identifiers and environment variables under the CapLiquify naming convention.
- `package.json`: updated package name and description to reference CapLiquify.

### Documentation

- `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_CHECKLIST.md`: full environment variable audit for CapLiquify naming and domains.
- `docs/RENDER_SUBDOMAIN_CLARIFICATION.md`: outlines Render subdomain behavior and mitigation.
- `docs/CLERK_AUTHENTICATION_FIX.md`: documents the authentication fix that accompanies the rename.
- `docs/FINAL_CLERK_SETUP.md`: step-by-step Clerk domain configuration for production.

### CORS Configuration

The `allowedOrigins` list in `server.js` now includes custom domains, legacy Render subdomains, and local development addresses:

```javascript
https://app.capliquify.com
https://api.capliquify.com
https://mcp.capliquify.com
https://capliquify.com
https://www.capliquify.com
https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com
https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com
https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com
```

## Benefits Delivered

Branding
- Eliminated public Sentia references across URLs, configuration, and copy.
- Achieved consistent naming between source code, infrastructure, and documentation.

Security and Reliability
- Leveraged Render-managed SSL certificates for all custom domains at no additional cost.
- Confirmed Clerk production keys continue to operate with the new origins once the allow-list is updated.
- Hardened CORS policy while retaining required fallbacks for legacy URLs and local development.

Developer Experience
- Provided predictable hostnames for manual testing and automated health checks.
- Added documentation that captures the reasoning, configuration steps, and validation plan.

Cost
- No new paid services were required; Render custom domains and SSL remain free under the existing plan.

## Completion Status and Next Actions

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure | Complete | All services renamed and serving through custom domains.
| Application code | Complete | Configuration files and branding updated.

### Next Steps (BMAD-REBRAND-006)

1. Follow `docs/FINAL_CLERK_SETUP.md` to register the custom domains in Clerk.
2. Validate authentication flows at https://app.capliquify.com after Clerk updates deploy.
3. Close the EPIC-007 tracking loop in BMAD by marking BMAD-REBRAND-006 complete and filing the retrospective entry.
