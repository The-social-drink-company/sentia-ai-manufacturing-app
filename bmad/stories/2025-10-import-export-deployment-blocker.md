**Blocker ID**: DEPLOY-BLOCK-001
**Epic**: Data Import/Export System Foundation
**Severity**: High
**Status**: üö® BLOCKING Phase 3 QA Testing
**Created**: 2025-10-18 03:12 BST

## Issue Summary

The development environment on Render has been suspended, blocking Phase 3 QA testing from proceeding as planned.

**Environment**: https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com

```

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected**:
- PR #15 merged ‚Üí Render auto-deployment triggered
- Health endpoint returns: `{ "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..." }`
- Application accessible at development URL

**Actual**:
- PR #15 merged successfully ‚úÖ
- Render service suspended (not deploying)
- HTTP 503 Service Unavailable with suspension message

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes

1. **Render Account Issue** (Most Likely)
   - Free tier limits exceeded
   - Billing issue
   - Account suspension
   - Service manually suspended

2. **Deployment Configuration**
   - render.yaml misconfiguration
   - Build failure causing suspension
   - Resource limits exceeded

3. **Cost Management**
   - Multiple services consuming resources
   - Database/Redis addon costs
   - Automatic suspension due to cost limits

### Investigation Required

- [ ] Check Render dashboard for account status
- [ ] Review billing and usage limits
- [ ] Check deployment logs for build failures
- [ ] Verify render.yaml configuration
- [ ] Review service settings (manual suspension toggle)

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Activities

**BMAD-QA-001 Test Plan**:
- ‚ùå **Day 1 AM**: Setup & smoke testing (BLOCKED)
- ‚ùå **Day 1 PM**: Functional testing suites 1-4 (BLOCKED)
- ‚ùå **Day 2 AM**: Admin & integration testing (BLOCKED)
- ‚ùå **Day 2 PM**: Performance, security, accessibility testing (BLOCKED)

**Specific Tests Blocked**:
- All end-to-end integration scenarios (5 scenarios)
- Performance benchmarks (8 benchmarks)
- Security tests (10 tests)
- Accessibility audit (Lighthouse score)
- Real-time SSE testing
- RBAC enforcement testing across environments

### Not Blocked (Can Continue)

**Local Development Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests (can run locally via `npm test`)
- ‚úÖ Component tests (can run locally)
- ‚úÖ Linting and code quality checks
- ‚úÖ Test fixture preparation (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Documentation review
- ‚úÖ Code review

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Restore Render Development Service (Recommended)
**Timeline**: Minutes to hours (depends on root cause)
**Effort**: Low to Medium
**Impact**: Unblocks all QA testing

**Actions**:
1. Access Render dashboard
2. Identify suspension reason
3. Resolve billing/account issue
4. Resume service or redeploy
5. Verify health endpoint
6. Proceed with BMAD-QA-001 as planned

**Pros**:
- Full QA testing possible
- No changes to test plan
- Uses intended deployment environment

**Cons**:
- Requires Render account access
- May require payment/billing action
- Timeline uncertain

### Option 2: Deploy to Alternative Environment
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Partial unblock

**Actions**:
1. Deploy to test environment (sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-test.onrender.com)
2. Verify test branch is updated
3. Merge feature branch to test branch
4. Execute QA testing on test environment

**Pros**:
- Existing test environment available
- Similar to development environment
- Can proceed with QA testing

**Cons**:
- Test environment may have different configuration
- May affect ongoing UAT if in use
- Not the intended workflow

### Option 3: Local Development Server Testing
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Partial unblock

**Actions**:
1. Start local development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Execute functional UI tests locally
3. Test API endpoints locally
4. Skip deployment-specific tests

**Pros**:
- Can start immediately
- No external dependencies
- Good for UI/functionality testing

**Cons**:
- Cannot test deployment-specific features
- Cannot test production build
- Cannot test real deployment environment
- Missing: Redis (BullMQ), production configs

### Option 4: Defer QA Testing Until Resolution
**Timeline**: Variable
**Effort**: None (wait)
**Impact**: Delays Phase 3

**Actions**:
1. Document blocker in BMAD story
2. Move to next epic or task
3. Resume QA when environment restored

**Pros**:
- No wasted effort on workarounds
- Can focus on other valuable work

**Cons**:
- Delays Import/Export epic completion
- Blocks production deployment
- Risk of context loss

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)

1. **Document Blocker** ‚úÖ (This document)
2. **Update BMAD-QA-001 Status**: Mark as BLOCKED
3. **Notify Stakeholders**: Environment issue blocking QA
4. **Investigate Render Account**: Check dashboard for suspension reason

### Short-term (Next 1-2 hours)

**If Render can be restored**:
- Resume BMAD-QA-001 testing immediately
- Execute full test plan as designed

**If Render cannot be restored quickly**:
- **Option 3**: Begin local testing (functional UI tests)
- Prepare test environment data
- Execute non-deployment-dependent tests
- Document which tests can/cannot be executed locally

### Medium-term (Next day)

**If still blocked**:
- **Option 2**: Deploy to alternative environment (test branch)
- Execute full QA test plan on test environment
- Document any environment differences

## BMAD Methodology Response

According to BMAD-METHOD Phase 4 iterative cycle:

```
‚úÖ 1. create-story (BMAD-UI-001)
‚úÖ 2. story-context
‚úÖ 3. dev-story
üö® 4. review-story (BMAD-QA-001 - BLOCKED by external dependency)
‚è∏Ô∏è  5. retrospective (deferred until QA complete)
```

**BMAD Guidance**: When blocked by external dependencies:
1. ‚úÖ Document the blocker
2. ‚úÖ Identify workarounds
3. ‚úÖ Continue valuable work where possible
4. ‚è≥ Escalate to remove blocker
5. ‚è≥ Resume workflow when unblocked

**Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Blocker documented (this document)
- ‚úÖ Workarounds identified (4 options)
- ‚úÖ Test fixtures created (valuable preparatory work)
- ‚è≥ Escalation needed (Render account access required)

   - Don't assume Render auto-deployment will succeed

2. **Environment Monitoring**
   - Monitor Render service status proactively
   - Set up alerts for service suspension
   - Track billing/usage limits

3. **Contingency Planning**
   - Always have backup testing environment
   - Document local testing procedures
   - Maintain test environment parity

4. **BMAD Workflow**
   - Plan for external dependency blockers
   - Define workaround procedures in advance
   - Build in buffer time for deployment issues
