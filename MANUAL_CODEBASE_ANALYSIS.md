## Phase 2: Current State Analysis

### Step 2.1: Analyze CLAUDE.md Current State

**Time**: 30 minutes

CLAUDE.md already contains a comprehensive analysis. Extract key data:

```bash
code analysis/CURRENT_STATE.md
```

**Template**:

```markdown
# Current Implementation State

## Date Analyzed: [today]

## Source: CLAUDE.md (lines referenced)

## Phase 3: Gap Analysis

### Step 3.1: Compare Original Intent vs Current State

**Time**: 1 hour

In Claude Code, ask me:

```
Please create a comprehensive gap analysis by comparing:
1. analysis/ORIGINAL_INTENT.md (what was planned)
2. analysis/CURRENT_STATE.md (what exists)

Generate a detailed report showing:
- Features planned but not implemented
- Features implemented differently than planned
- Features added that weren't in original plan
- Mock data locations that need real implementation
- Integration status for each planned integration

Save results to: analysis/GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

I'll generate a comprehensive report like this:

```markdown
# Gap Analysis: Original Intent vs Current Implementation

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

| Feature               | Original Plan  | Current Status       | Gap           | Priority |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------- |

## Phase 4: Technical Debt Assessment

### Step 4.1: Identify Technical Debt

**Time**: 1 hour

In Claude Code, ask me:

```
Please analyze the codebase for technical debt:

1. Run: npm run lint
2. Review recent git history for TODO/FIXME comments
3. Identify architectural concerns from file structure
4. Check integration error handling
5. Review test coverage

Generate a technical debt report at: analysis/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md
```

### Step 4.2: Analyze Integration Status

Ask me:

```
For each integration (Xero, Shopify, Amazon, Unleashed):
1. Review the integration code
2. Check error handling
3. Identify mock fallbacks
4. Assess completion percentage

Generate integration status report at: analysis/INTEGRATION_STATUS.md
```

---

## Phase 5: Create Prioritized Backlog

### Step 5.1: Generate Story List

**Time**: 1-2 hours

In Claude Code, use the `/create-feature` command or ask me:

```
Based on the gap analysis, create a prioritized story backlog:

1. One story per gap/feature
2. Include acceptance criteria
3. Estimate effort (days)
4. Assign business value (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. Identify dependencies

Format as stories in: analysis/stories/
```

### Step 5.2: Organize by Epic

Ask me to organize stories:

```
Organize the stories into epics:

Epic 1: Eliminate Mock Data
- Story 1.1: Replace What-If mock calculations
- Story 1.2: Implement real Business Intelligence
- Story 1.3: Add real-time event streaming

Epic 2: Complete Integrations
- Story 2.1: Configure Amazon SP-API
- Story 2.2: Implement Amazon order sync
- Story 2.3: Complete Unleashed manufacturing sync

[etc...]

Save to: analysis/EPIC_BREAKDOWN.md
```

### Step 5.3: Create Sprint Plan

```
Create a sprint-by-sprint implementation plan:

Sprint 1 (2 weeks): Critical Mock Data
Sprint 2 (2 weeks): Amazon Integration
Sprint 3 (2 weeks): Unleashed Completion
Sprint 4 (2 weeks): Technical Debt

For each sprint, include:
- Goals
- Stories included
- Success criteria
- Testing requirements

Save to: analysis/SPRINT_PLAN.md
```

## Phase 6: Implementation Roadmap

### Step 6.1: Create Timeline

Ask me:

```
Create a visual timeline showing:

Month 1:
‚îú‚îÄ Sprint 1: Critical fixes
‚îî‚îÄ Sprint 2: Amazon integration

Month 2:
‚îú‚îÄ Sprint 3: Unleashed completion
‚îî‚îÄ Sprint 4: Technical debt

Month 3:
‚îú‚îÄ Sprint 5: Performance optimization
‚îî‚îÄ Sprint 6: Final testing

Save to: analysis/ROADMAP.md

## Using Claude Code for Each Step

### For Each Phase, Use This Pattern:

1. **Ask me to help**:

   ```
   "Please help me with Phase [X], Step [Y] of the manual analysis.
   Read [files] and generate [output]."
   ```

2. **I'll do the analysis**:
   - Read the files
   - Analyze the code
   - Generate the report
   - Save to the specified location

3. **Review my output**:
   - Read the generated file
   - Add your notes
   - Correct anything I missed

### Example Conversation Flow:

**You**: "Claude, let's start Phase 2. Please read CLAUDE.md and extract the current implementation status. Create analysis/CURRENT_STATE.md with a comprehensive breakdown of what's complete, partial, and missing."

**Me**: [Reads CLAUDE.md, analyzes, generates CURRENT_STATE.md]

**You**: [Reviews the file, adds notes]

**You**: "Great! Now let's do Phase 3. Compare analysis/ORIGINAL_INTENT.md with analysis/CURRENT_STATE.md and create a gap analysis."

**Me**: [Analyzes both files, generates GAP_ANALYSIS.md]

---

## Advantages of This Approach

### vs BMAD CLI:

‚úÖ **No installation required** - uses tools you already have
‚úÖ **More flexible** - adapt to your specific needs
‚úÖ **Better for learning** - you understand each step
‚úÖ **Claude Code integration** - I can read/write files directly
‚úÖ **Customizable** - adjust as you go
‚úÖ **Works on Windows** - no permission issues

### Same Results:

‚úÖ Complete codebase analysis
‚úÖ Gap identification
‚úÖ Story backlog
‚úÖ Implementation roadmap
‚úÖ Technical debt inventory

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Analysis Directory

```powershell
# Create directory structure
mkdir analysis
mkdir analysis/stories
mkdir analysis/stories/epic-01-eliminate-mock
mkdir analysis/stories/epic-02-complete-integrations
mkdir analysis/stories/epic-03-technical-debt
```

### Step 2: Start with Phase 1

In Claude Code chat, say:

```
Let's start the manual codebase analysis. I'll follow the MANUAL_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md guide.

Phase 1, Step 1.1: Please read these files and help me document the original intent:
- context/business-requirements/sentia_business_model.md
- context/business-requirements/acceptance_criteria.md
- context/business-requirements/user_workflows.md

Create analysis/ORIGINAL_INTENT.md with a summary of:
- Business goals
- Target users
- Core features planned
- Success criteria
```

### Step 3: Continue Through All Phases

Work through each phase, asking me to help with each step.

---

## Estimated Time

- **Phase 1** (Doc Review): 30-60 minutes
- **Phase 2** (Current State): 30-60 minutes
- **Phase 3** (Gap Analysis): 1-2 hours (I'll help!)
- **Phase 4** (Technical Debt): 1-2 hours (I'll help!)
- **Phase 5** (Backlog): 2-3 hours (I'll help!)
- **Phase 6** (Roadmap): 1 hour (I'll help!)

**Total**: 6-10 hours spread over a few days

But I'll do most of the heavy lifting! You just need to:

- Review what I generate
- Add your insights
- Make decisions on priorities

---

## Success Criteria

By the end, you'll have:

‚úÖ Complete understanding of original vs current state
‚úÖ Every mock data location documented
‚úÖ Prioritized story backlog ready for sprints
‚úÖ Implementation roadmap with timeline
‚úÖ Technical debt inventory with effort estimates
‚úÖ Integration status for all APIs

**Same outcome as BMAD Method, just using manual + Claude Code approach!**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create the analysis directory**:

   ```powershell
   mkdir analysis
   mkdir analysis/stories
   ```

2. **Start Phase 1** by asking me in Claude Code:

   ```
   "Let's start Phase 1 of the manual codebase analysis..."
   ```

3. **Work through each phase** with my help
