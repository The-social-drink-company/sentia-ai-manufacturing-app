# Daily Log - BMAD Method

## 2025-10-20
- Completed **BMAD-DEV-001** to restore development bypass defaults and unblock dashboard access without Clerk credentials.
- Added `useAIMetrics` hook with deterministic fallback data; AI Insights panel now renders offline.
- Realigned `FinancialAlgorithms` service with `/financial/*` API responses and labelled development-only fallbacks to respect the "no mock" contract.
- Updated BMAD update queue to flag the AI Insights and financial service gaps as resolved.
- Noted missing pnpm executable locally; relied on `npx eslint` for targeted lint checks (ignored files warning only).
- Completed **BMAD-DEV-002** by enriching `/api/ai/insights` with structured insight objects and summary metadata, matching the frontend schema while flagging development fallbacks.
- Normalized docs/SENTIA_TO_CAPLIQUIFY_RENAMING_GUIDE.md content to ASCII, refreshed BMAD summary, and cross-linked supporting documentation.
## 2025-10-21
- Updated /api/working-capital to use the existing InventoryItem schema, remove missing-table queries, and surface a clear 503 when Xero is disconnected.
- Restored /server/routes/api.js to aggregate first-party routers under /api, preventing runtime import failures during server start.
- Logged new blocker that half of the mounted routes depend on unresolved tenant tables; flagged for follow-up in upcoming BMAD action items.
- Rechecked git status for EPIC-007 tracking; latest commit still b967de6b on main with large workspace deltas pending triage, no new PRs detected locally.
- Render health remains unverified due to restricted network access; flagged need for external dashboard check before declaring deployment green.
