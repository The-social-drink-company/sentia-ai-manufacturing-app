# Infrastructure Issue: Branch Mismatch in Render Deployment

**Issue ID**: INFRA-001
**Severity**: MEDIUM (Blocking deployment verification, but service is live)
**Created**: 2025-10-18 16:45 BST
**Updated**: 2025-10-18 17:00 BST
**Status**: RESOLVED - Root cause identified, solution documented

## Problem Summary

~~All Render deployment environments for the CapLiquify Platform AI Dashboard are currently suspended~~

**UPDATE**: Services are NOT suspended - they are deploying successfully but from the **wrong branch** (`main` instead of `development`). The Import/Export UI (BMAD-UI-001) was merged to the `development` branch but Render is configured to deploy from `main`, which lacks these changes.

## Affected Services

### Development Environment
- **URL**: https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com
- **Status**: SUSPENDED

### Testing Environment
- **URL**: https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-test.onrender.com
- **Status**: UNKNOWN (likely suspended)
- **Service**: sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-test
- **Impact**: Cannot perform UAT scenarios

## Root Cause Analysis

**Actual Cause**: Branch mismatch between documentation and Render configuration

### Evidence from Deployment Logs:
```
2025-10-18T01:58:36.094723852Z ==> Cloning from https://github.com/dudleypeacockqa/sentia-manufacturing-dashboard
2025-10-18T01:58:38.905747848Z ==> Checking out commit 8b8c846c33f99e1dabfde1b8b5e79e31300b848b in branch main
...
2025-10-18T01:59:16.841244683Z ==> Your site is live üéâ
```

**Findings**:
1. ‚úÖ Service is deploying successfully
2. ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
3. ‚ùå Deploying from `main` branch (commit `8b8c846c`)
4. ‚ùå Import/Export work is in `development` branch (commit `ba03fe46`)
5. ‚ùå PR #15 merged to `development` but not to `main`

### Git Branch Status:
- **main branch**: Last commit `1227ac36` - "fix: Create render-production.yaml..."
- **development branch**: Last commit `ba03fe46` - Includes PR #15 with Import/Export UI
- **Mismatch**: 28 commits ahead in `development` vs `main`

### Configuration Issue:
- **CLAUDE.md says**: "Development branch deploys to sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h"
- **Render actually does**: Deploys `main` branch to all environments
- **render.yaml**: No `branch` specification (defaults to repo's default branch)

---

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Work:
- ‚úÖ **Development COMPLETE**: PR #15 merged to development branch (commit 1bcd41b3)
- ‚ùå **Deployment Verification BLOCKED**: Cannot verify auto-deployment
- ‚ùå **Smoke Testing BLOCKED**: Cannot access UI to verify routing/navigation
- ‚ùå **End-to-End Testing BLOCKED**: Cannot test full import/export flows
- ‚ùå **QA Review BLOCKED**: Cannot perform UAT scenarios
- ‚ùå **User Acceptance BLOCKED**: Cannot demo to stakeholders

### Code Status:
- ‚úÖ All code changes committed and pushed to development branch
- ‚úÖ All components implemented and passing unit tests
- ‚úÖ Code quality verified (0 errors, 15 warnings)
- ‚úÖ Git workflow clean and up-to-date

**Conclusion**: The code is deployment-ready, but infrastructure is blocking verification.

## Resolution Steps

### Solution: Merge development to main OR Configure Render Branch

**Option 1: Merge development ‚Üí main** (Recommended):

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge development branch
git merge development

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Verify deployment logs on Render
# Expected: Auto-deploy triggers with latest commits
```

**Option 2: Configure Render to deploy from development**:

1. Access Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Navigate to service `sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h`
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branch
4. Change from `main` to `development`
5. Save and trigger manual deploy
6. **Note**: This would contradict CLAUDE.md documentation about branch workflow

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (merge to main) as it aligns with the documented workflow where `development` is tested first, then promoted to `main`/`production`.

### Post-Resolution Actions (Development Team):

1. **Verify Service Reactivation**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
   ```

2. **Monitor Auto-Deployment**:
   - Check Render dashboard for deployment status
   - Verify development branch auto-deploys after reactivation
   - Monitor build logs for errors

3. **Smoke Testing**:
   - Login to development environment
   - Navigate to /app/admin/import
   - Navigate to /app/admin/export
   - Verify pages load without errors
   - Check sidebar navigation shows new links

4. **Continue BMAD Workflow**:
   - Resume deployment checklist: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST-BMAD-UI-001.md`
   - Perform UAT scenarios
   - Complete QA review
   - Get stakeholder approval

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Alternative Hosting (Temporary)
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify for immediate testing
- Update `.env` files with temporary URLs
- Continue development and testing
- **Downside**: Requires reconfiguration and may have different behavior

### Option 2: Local Development (Limited)
- Run application locally with `pnpm dev`
- Test UI components and routing
- **Downside**: Cannot test SSE with BullMQ queues (requires Redis)
- **Downside**: Cannot test actual file uploads/downloads

### Option 3: Wait for Resolution (Recommended)
- Continue with backend API implementation (BMAD-API-001)
- Write additional tests (BMAD-TEST-001)
- Improve documentation
- **Upside**: No wasted effort on temporary solutions
- **Upside**: Productive work while waiting for infrastructure

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Monitoring Setup:
1. **Uptime Monitoring**:
   - Configure UptimeRobot or similar service
   - Monitor all three environments (dev, test, production)
   - Alert on downtime within 5 minutes

2. **Cost Monitoring**:
   - Set up Render billing alerts
   - Monitor resource usage dashboard weekly
   - Set budget limits to prevent overages

3. **Health Check Automation**:
   - Add health check to CI/CD pipeline
   - Fail builds if health check returns suspension page
   - Alert team immediately on suspension

### Billing Best Practices:
1. **Payment Method Backup**:
   - Add secondary payment method
   - Enable automatic payment retry
   - Set up billing notifications

2. **Usage Review**:
   - Review Render usage monthly
   - Optimize resource allocation
   - Consider upgrading plan if frequently hitting limits

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use free tier efficiently
   - Scale down unused services
   - Consider consolidating environments

## Communication

### Stakeholder Notification:

**Subject**: Import/Export Epic Deployment Blocked by Infrastructure Issue

**Message**:
```
The Import/Export epic (BMAD-UI-001) is complete and code has been merged to the development branch. However, deployment verification is currently blocked due to Render service suspension.

**Current Status**:
‚úÖ Development COMPLETE (PR #15 merged)
‚úÖ Code Quality VERIFIED (0 errors)
‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment BLOCKED (Render suspension)

**Next Steps**:
1. Account owner to resolve Render service suspension
2. Development team to verify deployment once service is restored
3. Continue with QA review and UAT testing

**Estimated Resolution**: Pending account owner action (typically 1-2 business days)

**Impact**: No code changes blocked, only deployment verification and testing delayed.
```
