---

## EPIC-002: Eliminate All Mock Data ✅ **COMPLETE** (100%)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Duration**: 3.5 weeks estimated, 4 days + 2 hours actual (96% faster)
**Stories**: 10/10 complete (100%)
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19

### Epic Goal

Replace ALL mock data, hardcoded fallbacks, and simulated values with real data from external APIs (Xero, Shopify, Amazon SP-API, Unleashed). Ensure graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable (return 503 with setup instructions, never fake data).

5. **Sprint Velocity Acceleration**: Story 1 (100%) → Story 2 (24%) → Story 5 (25%) → Story 6 (8%) → Story 8 (50%) = accelerating velocity
6. **Pattern Reuse Delivers**: Each integration story after BMAD-MOCK-001 takes 70-92% less time than estimated
7. **Service Discovery Critical**: Always audit existing code before estimating - prevents re-implementation
8. **Auto-Systems Work Ahead**: Linter/auto-commit systems often complete tasks (e.g., SSE events) before manual implementation
9. **Verification Stories Fast**: BMAD-MOCK-008 took 15 minutes (50% of 30-min estimate) - grep + manual review pattern efficient
10. **SSE Passive Broadcaster Pattern**: Correct architecture - SSE service only distributes events, never generates business data

- **Professional Polish**: Smooth animations and tooltips signal attention to detail

### Epic Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All pages implement skeleton loading states (no generic spinners)
- [ ] Error boundaries wrap all major sections (root, page, widget levels)
- [ ] Setup prompts integrated on all pages requiring external APIs (Xero, Shopify, Amazon, Unleashed)
