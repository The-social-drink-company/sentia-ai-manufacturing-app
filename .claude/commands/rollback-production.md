# Rollback Production Deployment

Emergency rollback procedure for production environment issues.

## üö® EMERGENCY USE ONLY

This command should only be used when:
- Production deployment has critical bugs
- Application is non-functional
- Data integrity is at risk
- Security vulnerability discovered

## Pre-Rollback Assessment

### 1. Severity Check

Confirm the issue severity:
- **P0 - Critical**: Application completely down, data loss risk
- **P1 - High**: Major functionality broken, affecting all users
- **P2 - Medium**: Specific features broken, workarounds exist
- **P3 - Low**: Minor issues, can wait for proper fix

**Only proceed with rollback for P0 or P1 issues.**

### 2. Issue Documentation

Before rollback, document:
- What is broken?
- When was it discovered?
- What was the last working state?
- Error messages/logs
- Steps to reproduce

### 3. Stakeholder Notification

Alert:
- Technical team
- Product owner
- Customer support
- Affected users (if necessary)

## Rollback Options

### Option A: Git Revert (Recommended)

Safer approach - creates new commit that undoes changes:

```bash
# 1. Check production history
git checkout production
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Identify bad commit
# 3. Revert it
git revert [commit-sha]

# 4. Push revert
git push origin production
```

### Option B: Reset to Previous Commit (Nuclear Option)

More dangerous - rewrites history:

```bash
# 1. Find last known good commit
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Reset to that commit
git reset --hard [good-commit-sha]

# 3. Force push (DANGEROUS)
git push origin production --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Option B rewrites history. Only use if Option A fails.

### Option C: Render Dashboard Rollback

Use Render's built-in rollback:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select production service
3. Go to "Events" tab
4. Find last successful deployment
5. Click "Rollback" button

## Rollback Execution

### Phase 1: Preparation

```
üö® PRODUCTION ROLLBACK INITIATED

Current Status:
- Production: ‚ùå Issues detected
- Issue: [description]
- Severity: P[0-1]
- Time Detected: [timestamp]

Rollback Target:
- Commit: [sha]
- Deployed: [timestamp]
- Version: [tag]
```

### Phase 2: Execute Rollback

Follow chosen option above, then monitor:

```bash
# Watch Render logs
# Check application health
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-production.onrender.com/health

# Verify critical endpoints
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-production.onrender.com/api/status
```

### Phase 3: Verification

Check that rolled-back version:
- ‚úÖ Application loads
- ‚úÖ Health check passes
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ Critical features functional
- ‚úÖ No error logs
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity OK

## Post-Rollback Actions

### 1. Immediate

- ‚úÖ Confirm production is stable
- ‚úÖ Notify stakeholders of resolution
- ‚úÖ Document what was rolled back
- ‚úÖ Update status page (if applicable)

### 2. Investigation

Create incident report:
```
PRODUCTION INCIDENT REPORT

Date: [date]
Duration: [start] - [end]
Severity: P[level]

What Happened:
[Description of issue]

Root Cause:
[What caused the problem]

Resolution:
Rolled back to commit [sha]

Impact:
- Users Affected: [number/percentage]
- Features Impacted: [list]
- Data Loss: Yes/No

Timeline:
- [time] - Issue deployed
- [time] - Issue detected
- [time] - Rollback initiated
- [time] - Production restored

Prevention:
[What will prevent this in future]
```

### 3. Fix Forward

After rollback:
1. Identify root cause in development
2. Create fix
3. Test thoroughly in development
4. Deploy to test environment
5. Extensive UAT before production retry

## Deployment Pipeline Pause

After rollback, add gate:
```
‚õî PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT PAUSED

Reason: Investigating recent rollback
Next Deployment: Requires explicit approval

Before next production deployment:
[ ] Root cause identified
[ ] Fix implemented and tested
[ ] Deployed to test environment
[ ] UAT completed
[ ] Code review completed
[ ] Stakeholder approval obtained
```

## Communication Templates

### To Stakeholders
