### API Integration Status

Run this to check all integrations:

```bash
npm run render:verify
```

Expected output:

```
Development: âœ… All services connected
Testing: âœ… All services connected
Production: âœ… All services connected
```

### Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] Development: <5s initial load
- [ ] Testing: <5s initial load
- [ ] Production: <3s initial load
- [ ] API responses: <500ms average
