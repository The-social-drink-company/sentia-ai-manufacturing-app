## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Sprint | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| External API credentials delays | 1-2 | Request credentials early, use sandbox/staging | ‚è≥ |
| Amazon SP-API complexity | 2 | Allocate buffer time, consult documentation | ‚è≥ |
| Test coverage below target | 4 | Incremental testing from Sprint 1, not Sprint 4 | ‚è≥ |
| Performance degradation | 5 | Continuous monitoring, load testing in Sprint 4 | ‚è≥ |

### Contingency Plans

- **Sprint 1 Delay**: Parallel track Sprint 2 stories that don't depend on Sprint 1
- **API Integration Blocked**: Use staging/sandbox environments, document real config for later
- **Test Coverage Gap**: Extend Sprint 4 by 2-3 days, defer non-critical UX polish
- **Production Issues**: Rollback procedure tested in Sprint 5 Day 3

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Required By | Lead Time | Status |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Xero OAuth credentials | Sprint 1 | 0 days | ‚úÖ HAVE |
| Shopify API keys (3 stores) | Sprint 1 | 1 day | ‚è≥ PENDING |
| Amazon SP-API credentials | Sprint 2 | 3-5 days | ‚è≥ PENDING |
| Unleashed API access | Sprint 2 | 1-2 days | ‚è≥ PENDING |
| Production Render account | Sprint 5 | 0 days | ‚úÖ HAVE |

### Technical Dependencies

- Sprint 3 depends on Sprint 2 (need real data for empty states)
- Sprint 4 depends on Sprint 2 & 3 (test complete features)
- Sprint 5 depends on ALL previous sprints (can't deploy incomplete system)
