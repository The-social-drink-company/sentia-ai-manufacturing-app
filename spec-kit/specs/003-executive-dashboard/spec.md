## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an executive or board member, I need a high-level overview of critical business metrics and strategic indicators, so I can make informed decisions and quickly identify areas requiring attention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an executive user logs in, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see prioritized KPIs relevant to board-level decisions
2. **Given** a KPI shows negative trend, **When** executive views it, **Then** the metric is highlighted with contextual alert information
3. **Given** executive clicks on a KPI, **When** drill-down is triggered, **Then** they navigate to detailed analysis view
4. **Given** multiple critical alerts exist, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** alerts are grouped by business impact
5. **Given** executive customizes layout, **When** they return, **Then** their preferred configuration is restored

### Edge Cases
- What happens when real-time data is unavailable? Shows cached data with timestamp and refresh option
- How does system handle conflicting metrics? Displays confidence intervals and data source indicators
- What if user lacks specific permissions? Shows aggregated data without sensitive details
