## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MCP server not available"
**Solution:**
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Wait for "Installing MCP server" to complete (first run only)
3. Try query again after 1-2 minutes

### Issue: "No services found"
**Solution:**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check you're using the right Render account
3. Ensure services exist in Render dashboard

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:**
1. API key may not have full access
2. Create a new API key with proper permissions
3. Update config and restart

### Issue: "Timeout error"
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Render services are accessible
3. Try a simpler query first
