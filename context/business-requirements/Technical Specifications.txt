5. System Architecture
5.1 High-level Architecture
5.1.1 System Overview
The Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard employs a modern cloud-native microservices architecture designed specifically for manufacturing intelligence and real-time operational decision-making. This architecture includes how components are designed, how data flows between react components, and how they manage things like user interactions and changes in the application state. The system follows a layered service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, data access, and integration layers.

Architectural Style and Rationale:
The architecture adopts a hybrid microservices pattern optimized for manufacturing data processing, combining the benefits of microservices scalability with the performance requirements of real-time manufacturing operations. Many of the features in React 18 are built on top of our new concurrent renderer, a behind-the-scenes change that unlocks powerful new capabilities. It's a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time. This enables the system to handle concurrent manufacturing processes while maintaining data consistency across multiple production facilities and sales channels.

Key Architectural Principles:

Domain-Driven Design: Services are organized around manufacturing business domains (production, inventory, forecasting, finance) rather than technical functions
Event-Driven Architecture: BullMQ is a Node.js library that implements a fast and robust queue system built on top of Redis that helps in resolving many modern age micro-services architectures
CQRS Pattern: Separation of command and query responsibilities for optimal read/write performance in manufacturing data scenarios
Reactive Architecture: Real-time data propagation using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for immediate manufacturing alerts and dashboard updates
System Boundaries and Major Interfaces:
The system maintains clear boundaries between internal manufacturing intelligence services and external integration points. The primary principle of the most popular architectures is to separate the technical concerns (e.g., HTTP, DB, etc) from the pure logic of the app so a developer can code more features without worrying about infrastructural concerns. Putting each concern in a dedicated folder, also known as the 3-Tier pattern, is the simplest way to meet this goal. The architecture supports multi-regional operations (UK, EU, US) with timezone-aware processing and compliance-ready audit trails.

5.1.2 Core Components Table
Component Name	Primary Responsibility	Key Dependencies	Integration Points
React Dashboard Frontend	User interface rendering, real-time updates, role-based access control	React 18, TanStack Query, SSE client	Express API, Clerk Auth, CDN
Express API Gateway	Request routing, authentication middleware, rate limiting, SSE endpoints	Express 4.21.2, Clerk SDK, Redis	Frontend, BullMQ, Prisma ORM
BullMQ Processing Engine	Background job orchestration, AI model execution, data synchronization	Redis, Worker processes	External APIs, ML services
Prisma Data Layer	Type-safe database operations, schema management, query optimization	PostgreSQL, Neon platform	All business services
5.1.3 Data Flow Description
Primary Data Flows:
The system implements a multi-tier data flow architecture optimized for manufacturing intelligence. BullMQ Redis refers to the use of Redis as the storage engine and messaging broker that powers BullMQ's job queues. Redis is responsible for storing all queue data, managing job states, handling delayed jobs, coordinating workers, and ensuring consistency across distributed systems. Raw operational data flows from external systems (Amazon SP-API, Shopify, Unleashed ERP) through the integration layer into the BullMQ processing engine for transformation and enrichment.

Integration Patterns and Protocols:

Real-time Integration: Webhook-based event processing for immediate manufacturing alerts
Batch Integration: Scheduled data synchronization for historical analysis and reporting
Stream Processing: BullMQ is a lightweight, robust, and fast NodeJS library for creating background jobs and sending messages using queues. It is backed by Redis, which makes it easy to scale horizontally and process jobs across multiple servers
Data Transformation Points:
Critical data transformation occurs at three key points: (1) API integration layer for external data normalization, (2) BullMQ workers for business logic application and AI model processing, and (3) Prisma data layer for optimized storage and retrieval patterns.

Key Data Stores and Caches:

Primary Storage: The future of Prisma ORM is here: The Rust-free version of Prisma ORM and the ESM-first prisma-client generator are both Generally Available in v6.16.0
Cache Layer: Redis for session management, job queues, and real-time data caching
CDN Storage: Cloudflare for static assets and global content delivery

For interactions that triggered heavy state updates, they used startTransition (React 18's concurrency API) to mark those updates as low priority, allowing React to delay non-urgent updates if a high-priority event (like another user input) comes in, keeping the interface responsive.

Scaling Considerations:
The frontend leverages React 18's concurrent features and code-splitting strategies to maintain performance under high user loads. CDN distribution through Cloudflare ensures global accessibility with sub-second load times.

5.2.3 Bullmq Processing Engine
Purpose and Responsibilities:
The BullMQ Processing Engine orchestrates all background manufacturing operations, including AI model execution, data synchronization, and complex business logic processing. The next state for a job is the "active" state. A job can be in the active state for an unlimited amount of time until the process is completed or an exception is thrown so that the job will end in either the "completed" or the "failed" status. The engine ensures reliable processing of manufacturing workflows with comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms.

Technologies and Frameworks:

Core Library: BullMQ 5.58.7 with Redis-based job persistence
Worker Architecture: Multi-process worker pools for parallel job execution
Job Scheduling: Cron-based scheduling for recurring manufacturing operations
Error Handling: Dead letter queues and exponential backoff retry strategies
Monitoring: Comprehensive job lifecycle tracking and performance metrics
Key Interfaces and APIs:

Job Producer Interface: Queue management for adding manufacturing jobs
Worker Interface: Job processing with sandboxed execution environments
Event Interface: Job lifecycle events for monitoring and alerting
Admin Interface: Queue management and job inspection capabilities
Data Persistence Requirements:
Each job is stored as a JSON object inside a Redis hash, indexed by job ID. Since Redis is the backbone of BullMQ, its health directly affects queue performance. All job data, state transitions, and results are persisted in Redis with configurable retention policies.

Scaling Considerations:
Easy to scale horizontally. Add more workers for processing jobs in parallel. The processing engine supports horizontal scaling through Redis clustering and can distribute workers across multiple servers for high-throughput manufacturing operations.

5.3 Technical Decisions
5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions And Tradeoffs
Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture Decision:

Decision Factor	Microservices (Chosen)	Monolithic Alternative	Rationale
Scalability	Independent service scaling	Entire application scaling	Manufacturing workloads vary significantly by function
Development Velocity	Parallel team development	Single codebase coordination	Multiple specialized teams (production, finance, supply chain)
Technology Flexibility	Service-specific technology choices	Uniform technology stack	AI/ML services require different optimization than web services
Operational Complexity	Higher deployment complexity	Simpler deployment model	Manufacturing systems require high availability and fault isolation
Event-Driven vs Request-Response Communication:

The architecture adopts a hybrid communication pattern combining synchronous request-response for user interactions with asynchronous event-driven processing for manufacturing operations. Job queues are essential for decoupling time-consuming tasks from the main application flow. By delegating tasks like image processing, report generation, or batch operations to background workers, applications can maintain responsiveness and scalability. This decision enables real-time user experience while ensuring reliable processing of critical manufacturing workflows.

5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices
Server-Sent Events (SSE) vs WebSocket Decision:

Aspect	SSE (Chosen)	WebSocket Alternative	Manufacturing Context
Connection Overhead	Lower server resource usage	Higher memory per connection	Manufacturing dashboards have many concurrent viewers
Browser Compatibility	Native browser support	Requires polyfills for older browsers	Manufacturing environments often use legacy browsers
Automatic Reconnection	Built-in reconnection logic	Manual reconnection implementation	Critical for 24/7 manufacturing operations
Firewall Traversal	Standard HTTP, better firewall support	May require special firewall configuration	Manufacturing networks have strict security policies
BullMQ vs Alternative Queue Systems:

The fastest, most reliable, Redis-based distributed queue for Node. Carefully written for rock solid stability and atomicity. BullMQ was selected over alternatives like AWS SQS or RabbitMQ due to its Redis-based architecture providing both job queuing and caching capabilities, reducing infrastructure complexity while maintaining the performance requirements for manufacturing operations.

5.3.3 Data Storage Solution Rationale
PostgreSQL vs NoSQL Database Decision:

Manufacturing data requires ACID compliance for financial transactions, complex relational queries for supply chain analysis, and strong consistency for inventory management. This is a demonstration of CAP Theorem — a statement describing the interplay between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems — in action. Some systems offer weaker consistency guarantees to maintain availability, while other databases refuse to accept changes if their peers cannot coordinate the transaction at the time of the write. PostgreSQL's mature ecosystem and Prisma's type-safe ORM integration provide the reliability required for manufacturing operations.

Neon vs Traditional PostgreSQL Hosting:

Feature	Neon (Chosen)	Traditional Hosting	Manufacturing Benefit
Scaling	Automatic serverless scaling	Manual capacity planning	Handles variable manufacturing workloads
Backup/Recovery	Automated point-in-time recovery	Manual backup configuration	Critical for manufacturing data protection
Connection Pooling	Built-in connection management	Requires separate pooling solution	Optimizes for concurrent manufacturing processes
Cost Model	Pay-per-use scaling	Fixed capacity costs	Aligns with variable manufacturing operations
5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification
Multi-Tier Caching Architecture:

The system implements a three-tier caching strategy optimized for manufacturing data access patterns:

L1 Cache (Application Memory): Hot manufacturing KPIs with 5-minute TTL
L2 Cache (Redis): Warm operational data with 1-hour TTL
L3 Cache (Database Query Cache): Historical data with 24-hour refresh cycle
Speed Redis operates entirely in memory, which makes it extremely fast. This allows BullMQ Redis to process thousands of jobs per second with low latency. This approach ensures sub-second response times for critical manufacturing metrics while maintaining data consistency for operational decisions.

5.3.5 Security Mechanism Selection
Clerk vs Custom Authentication Decision:

Security Aspect	Clerk (Chosen)	Custom Implementation	Manufacturing Requirement
Compliance	SOC 2, GDPR compliant	Requires custom compliance work	Manufacturing data requires regulatory compliance
Multi-Factor Authentication	Built-in MFA support	Custom MFA implementation	Critical for administrative manufacturing functions
Role-Based Access Control	Advanced RBAC with hierarchical roles	Custom role management	Manufacturing requires complex permission hierarchies
Session Management	Enterprise-grade session handling	Custom session security	24/7 manufacturing operations require robust sessions

5.4 Cross-cutting Concerns
5.4.1 Monitoring And Observability Approach
Comprehensive Manufacturing Intelligence Monitoring:

The system implements a three-pillar observability strategy specifically designed for manufacturing operations: metrics, logs, and traces. Monitoring your Node.js microservices is crucial. Quicker bug fixes, easier pattern spotting, and less time wasted. Manufacturing systems require specialized monitoring for production KPIs, equipment health, and supply chain metrics beyond traditional application monitoring.

Key Monitoring Components:

Monitoring Layer	Technology	Manufacturing Focus	Alert Thresholds
Infrastructure	Render built-in monitoring	Server health, auto-scaling metrics	CPU >80%, Memory >85%
Application	Custom metrics via Express middleware	API response times, error rates	Response time >200ms, Error rate >1%
Business	Manufacturing KPI dashboards	OEE, inventory levels, cash flow	OEE <85%, Inventory variance >10%
User Experience	Real-time SSE connection monitoring	Dashboard responsiveness, data freshness	SSE disconnect >30s, Data age >5min
5.4.2 Logging And Tracing Strategy
Structured Logging for Manufacturing Operations:

This sets up Winston to log errors and other info separately. The system implements structured JSON logging with manufacturing-specific context including production line identifiers, batch numbers, and operational timestamps. All logs include correlation IDs for tracing requests across the distributed manufacturing intelligence system.

Audit Trail Requirements:
Manufacturing operations require comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOC 2) and operational analysis. The system maintains immutable audit logs with cryptographic integrity verification for all user actions, system changes, and manufacturing decisions.

Distributed Tracing Implementation:
Need to follow requests between services? Use a unique ID for each. Zipkin's great for this. Each manufacturing workflow receives a unique trace ID that follows the request through all system components, enabling end-to-end visibility for complex manufacturing processes.

5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns
Manufacturing-Specific Error Handling:

The system implements a hierarchical error handling strategy with different response patterns based on the criticality of manufacturing operations. Production-critical errors trigger immediate escalation, while non-critical errors follow standard retry patterns.

5.4.4 Authentication And Authorization Framework
Role-Based Access Control for Manufacturing:

The authentication framework implements a four-tier hierarchical RBAC system specifically designed for manufacturing organizations: ADMIN (system administration), MANAGER (operational decisions), OPERATOR (production execution), and VIEWER (read-only access). Each role has granular permissions aligned with manufacturing responsibilities and regulatory requirements.

Session Management for 24/7 Operations:
Manufacturing operations require continuous system availability with appropriate security controls. The system implements differentiated session timeouts based on user roles and risk levels: 4 hours for ADMIN users, 8 hours for MANAGER users, and 12 hours for OPERATOR/VIEWER users.

5.4.5 Performance Requirements And Slas
Manufacturing-Specific Performance Targets:

Performance Metric	Target Value	Business Impact	Monitoring Method
API Response Time	<200ms (95th percentile)	Real-time manufacturing decisions	Automated performance monitoring
Dashboard Load Time	<1 second	Operational efficiency	Frontend performance metrics
SSE Update Latency	<5 seconds	Production alert responsiveness	Real-time connection monitoring
Forecast Job Completion	<5 minutes	Production planning cycles	BullMQ job monitoring
Scalability Requirements:
The system must support 1000+ concurrent users during peak manufacturing operations, with automatic scaling capabilities to handle seasonal demand variations and multi-shift operations across global manufacturing facilities.

5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures
Manufacturing Continuity Planning:

Manufacturing operations cannot tolerate extended downtime, requiring robust disaster recovery procedures with aggressive Recovery Time Objectives (RTO: 15 minutes) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO: 1 hour). The system implements automated backup procedures with point-in-time recovery capabilities.

Data Protection Strategy:

Automated Backups: Neon PostgreSQL continuous backups with 30-day retention
Point-in-Time Recovery: 7-day PITR window for operational data recovery
Redis Persistence: Daily snapshots with 7-day retention for job queue recovery
Cross-Region Replication: Automated replication for business continuity
Failover Procedures:
The system supports automated failover for critical manufacturing operations with health check monitoring and automatic traffic routing. Manual failover procedures are documented for complex scenarios requiring operational intervention.

This comprehensive system architecture provides a robust foundation for the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance while meeting the specific requirements of modern manufacturing intelligence operations. The architecture balances technical excellence with practical manufacturing needs, enabling real-time decision-making and operational efficiency across global manufacturing operations.

6. System Components Design

6.1.2 Component Design Principles
Manufacturing-Specific Design Patterns:

React's component-based architecture lends itself naturally to composition. By using popular React design patterns such as Render Props and Compound Components, you can compose smaller, more focused components into larger, more complex interfaces. This leads to highly modular code that is easier to extend and update, as each component is responsible for a single piece of functionality.

Core Design Principles:

Single Responsibility Principle: Each component handles one specific manufacturing concern (KPI display, data visualization, user interaction)
Composition over Inheritance: The possibility of HOCs in React is due to React preference of composition over inheritance
Unidirectional Data Flow: In React, data flows in a unidirectional manner, meaning it moves from parent components to child components. Parent to Child: Data is passed down from parent components to child components via props
Separation of Concerns: The presentational and container components represent a design pattern approach that helps separate concerns and responsibilities in React applications. Presentational components are focused on how a user interface looks and feels. On the other hand, container components handle tasks like fetching data from servers, managing changes in data, and state management in React applications

Production Control	✓	✓	✓	✗
Working Capital	✓	✓	✗	✗
System Administration	✓	✗	✗	✗
Forecasting Models	✓	✓	✗	✓ (read-only)
6.3 Component Interaction Patterns
6.3.1 State Management Architecture
Global State Management:
Patterns like the Provider pattern help manage global state across the component tree, making it easier to pass data around without cluttering the component hierarchy. The dashboard implements a hybrid state management approach combining React Context for UI state and TanStack Query for server state.

State Categories:

State Type	Management Strategy	Examples
Authentication State	React Context	User profile, permissions, session status
UI State	React Context	Sidebar collapse, theme, notifications
Server State	TanStack Query	KPI data, production metrics, forecasts
Form State	Local useState	Filter selections, input forms
6.3.2 Component Communication Patterns
Parent-Child Communication:
Parent to Child: Data is passed down from parent components to child components via props. Child to Parent: If a child component needs to communicate with a parent, it can call a function passed down as a prop.

Event-Driven Communication:
For complex manufacturing workflows, the dashboard implements custom hooks for event-driven communication between components:

// Custom hook for manufacturing events
const useManufacturingEvents = () => {
  const { publish, subscribe } = useEventBus();
  
  const publishProductionAlert = (alert: ProductionAlert) => {
    publish('production:alert', alert);
  };
  
  const subscribeToQualityEvents = (callback: (event: QualityEvent) => void) => {
    return subscribe('quality:*', callback);
  };
  
  return { publishProductionAlert, subscribeToQualityEvents };
};
6.3.3 Performance Optimization Patterns
Component Memoization:
Custom hooks represent one of the most powerful patterns in modern React development. They enable the extraction of stateful logic into reusable functions, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

Optimization Strategies:

React.memo for Pure Components: Prevent unnecessary re-renders of KPI cards and charts
useMemo for Expensive Calculations: Cache complex manufacturing calculations
useCallback for Event Handlers: Prevent child component re-renders
Virtualization for Large Datasets: Implement virtual scrolling for production data tables
Code Splitting Strategy:

// Lazy loading for feature components
const ExecutiveDashboard = lazy(() => import('./ExecutiveDashboard'));
const WorkingCapitalAnalytics = lazy(() => import('./WorkingCapitalAnalytics'));
const ProductionIntelligence = lazy(() => import('./ProductionIntelligence'));

// Route-based code splitting
const DashboardRoutes = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/executive" element={<ExecutiveDashboard />} />
      <Route path="/working-capital" element={<WorkingCapitalAnalytics />} />
      <Route path="/production" element={<ProductionIntelligence />} />
    </Routes>
  </Suspense>
);
6.4 Real-time Component Architecture
6.4.1 Sse Integration Pattern
Real-Time Data Flow:
The dashboard implements Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates across all manufacturing components. Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern that optimizes systems' response and adaptability to real-time changes. This architecture allows applications to detect and react to events throughout the environment. These events trigger responses in the system, allowing for real-time processing and action.

SSE Component Hook:

const useSSEConnection = (endpoint: string) => {
  const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState<ConnectionStatus>('connecting');
  const [lastEvent, setLastEvent] = useState<SSEEvent | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const eventSource = new EventSource(endpoint);
    
    eventSource.onopen = () => setConnectionStatus('connected');
    eventSource.onerror = () => setConnectionStatus('disconnected');
    
    eventSource.addEventListener('kpi-update', (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      setLastEvent({ type: 'kpi-update', data, timestamp: Date.now() });
    });
    
    return () => eventSource.close();
  }, [endpoint]);
  
  return { connectionStatus, lastEvent };
};
6.4.2 Manufacturing Alert System
Alert Component Architecture:
The alert system implements a priority-based notification system with escalation rules for manufacturing operations.

Alert Types and Handling:

Alert Type	Priority	Auto-Escalation	Component Response
Production Line Down	Critical	Immediate	Red banner, audio alert
Quality Threshold Breach	High	5 minutes	Orange notification
Inventory Low	Medium	30 minutes	Yellow indicator
Forecast Accuracy Drop	Low	2 hours	Info badge
Alert Component Implementation:

const AlertsProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState<Alert[]>([]);
  const { lastEvent } = useSSEConnection('/api/alerts/stream');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (lastEvent?.type === 'alert') {
      const newAlert = lastEvent.data as Alert;
      setAlerts(prev => [newAlert, ...prev].slice(0, 100)); // Keep last 100 alerts
      
      // Trigger browser notification for critical alerts
      if (newAlert.priority === 'critical' && 'Notification' in window) {
        new Notification(newAlert.title, {
          body: newAlert.message,
          icon: '/icons/alert-critical.png'
        });
      }
    }
  }, [lastEvent]);
  
  return (
    <AlertsContext.Provider value={{ alerts, setAlerts }}>
      {children}
    </AlertsContext.Provider>
  );
};
6.5 Accessibility And Usability Patterns
6.5.1 Manufacturing Floor Accessibility
Accessibility Requirements:
Color Blindness Considerations: Avoid using color alone to convey information. Use patterns, labels, or icons in conjunction with color to differentiate data points. Screen Reader Compatibility: Design your dashboard so that screen readers can easily navigate and interpret it. Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.

Manufacturing-Specific Accessibility Features:

High Contrast Mode: For manufacturing floor displays with varying lighting conditions
Large Touch Targets: Minimum 44px touch targets for tablet interfaces
Voice Announcements: Audio alerts for critical production events
Keyboard Shortcuts: Quick navigation for power users
ARIA Implementation:

const KPICard = ({ title, value, status, trend }: KPICardProps) => (
  <div
    role="region"
    aria-labelledby={`kpi-${title}-title`}
    aria-describedby={`kpi-${title}-value kpi-${title}-trend`}
    className={`kpi-card kpi-card--${status}`}
  >
    <h3 id={`kpi-${title}-title`}>{title}</h3>
    <div
      id={`kpi-${title}-value`}
      aria-live="polite"
      aria-atomic="true"
    >
      {value}
    </div>
    <div
      id={`kpi-${title}-trend`}
      aria-label={`Trend: ${trend?.direction} ${trend?.percentage}%`}
    >
      <TrendIndicator trend={trend} />
    </div>
  </div>
);
6.5.2 Responsive Design Patterns
Device-Specific Optimizations:

Device Type	Screen Size	Component Adaptations
Desktop	>1200px	Full dashboard layout, multiple columns
Tablet	768-1199px	Collapsible sidebar, stacked components
Mobile	<768px	Bottom navigation, single column layout
Manufacturing Display	>1920px	Large fonts, high contrast, simplified UI
Responsive Component Hook:

const useResponsiveLayout = () => {
  const [screenSize, setScreenSize] = useState<ScreenSize>('desktop');
  const [orientation, setOrientation] = useState<'portrait' | 'landscape'>('landscape');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const updateLayout = () => {
      const width = window.innerWidth;
      const height = window.innerHeight;
      
      if (width < 768) setScreenSize('mobile');
      else if (width < 1200) setScreenSize('tablet');
      else setScreenSize('desktop');
      
      setOrientation(width > height ? 'landscape' : 'portrait');
    };
    
    updateLayout();
    window.addEventListener('resize', updateLayout);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateLayout);
  }, []);
  
  return { screenSize, orientation };
};
6.6 Testing And Quality Assurance
6.6.1 Component Testing Strategy
Testing Pyramid for Manufacturing Components:

Unit Tests: Individual component logic and rendering
Integration Tests: Component interaction and data flow
E2E Tests: Complete manufacturing workflows
Visual Regression Tests: UI consistency across updates
Component Test Example:

describe('KPICard Component', () => {
  it('displays critical status with proper ARIA attributes', () => {
    const props = {
      title: 'OEE',
      value: 65,
      status: 'critical' as const,
      target: 85
    };
    
    render(<KPICard {...props} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByRole('region')).toHaveAttribute('aria-labelledby', 'kpi-OEE-title');
    expect(screen.getByText('65')).toHaveAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/trend/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('updates value with SSE events', async () => {
    const { rerender } = render(<KPICard title="OEE" value={65} status="critical" />);
    
    // Simulate SSE update
    rerender(<KPICard title="OEE" value={87} status="good" />);
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('87')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
6.6.2 Performance Testing
Manufacturing-Specific Performance Requirements:

Component Type	Load Time Target	Update Frequency	Concurrent Users
KPI Cards	<100ms	Every 5 seconds	1000+
Charts	<500ms	Every 30 seconds	500+
Data Tables	<1 second	On demand	200+
Alerts	<50ms	Real-time	1000+
Performance Monitoring Hook:

const usePerformanceMonitoring = (componentName: string) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    return () => {
      const endTime = performance.now();
      const renderTime = endTime - startTime;
      
      // Report performance metrics
      if (renderTime > 100) {
        console.warn(`${componentName} render time: ${renderTime}ms`);
      }
      
      // Send to monitoring service
      analytics.track('component_render_time', {
        component: componentName,
        duration: renderTime,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      });
    };
  }, [componentName]);
};
This comprehensive system components design provides a robust foundation for the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and optimal user experience across all manufacturing operations. The component architecture balances technical excellence with practical manufacturing requirements, enabling real-time decision-making and operational efficiency.

6.1 Core Services Architecture
6.1.1 Service Components
Service Boundaries And Responsibilities
The Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard implements a hybrid microservices architecture optimized for manufacturing intelligence operations. BullMQ is a Node.js library that implements a fast and robust queue system built on top of Redis that helps in resolving many modern age micro-services architectures. BullMQ is a powerful message queue library that allows for job processing, communication between microservices, and task scheduling.

Service Component	Primary Responsibilities	Business Domain	Scaling Requirements
API Gateway Service	Request routing, authentication, rate limiting, SSE endpoints	Cross-cutting concerns	High availability, 1000+ concurrent users
Manufacturing Intelligence Service	KPI calculations, production metrics, OEE tracking	Production operations	CPU-intensive, auto-scaling based on demand
Forecasting Service	AI model execution, ensemble predictions, accuracy tracking	Demand planning	Memory-intensive, batch processing
Working Capital Service	Financial calculations, CCC analysis, cash runway projections	Financial analytics	Transaction consistency, real-time updates
Inter-service Communication Patterns
Easy to scale horizontally. Add more workers for processing jobs in parallel. The architecture employs multiple communication patterns optimized for manufacturing operations:

Asynchronous Message Queuing:

Primary Pattern: BullMQ-based job queues for background processing
Use Cases: AI model training, data synchronization, report generation
Benefits: Fault tolerance, horizontal scaling, job persistence
Server-Sent Events (SSE):

Primary Pattern: Real-time dashboard updates
Use Cases: Live KPI updates, production alerts, system notifications
Benefits: Browser-native, automatic reconnection, firewall-friendly
Synchronous HTTP APIs:

Primary Pattern: Request-response for user interactions
Use Cases: Authentication, data queries, configuration changes
Benefits: Immediate feedback, simple error handling, RESTful design
Service Discovery Mechanisms
The system implements a simplified service discovery pattern suitable for the Render deployment environment:

Real-time Data Cache

Service Registration Strategy:

Environment-based Configuration: Services register via environment variables
Health Check Endpoints: Each service exposes /health endpoints for monitoring
Load Balancer Integration: Render's built-in load balancing handles service discovery
Load Balancing Strategy
Render can automatically scale your service up and down based on CPU and/or memory utilization targets that you specify. Render begins monitoring resource utilization and automatically scales your service up or down as needed based on your specified targets.

Load Balancing Layer	Technology	Configuration	Manufacturing Optimization
External Load Balancer	Render Platform	Automatic distribution	Geographic routing for multi-region operations
Internal Load Balancer	Express.js clustering	Round-robin algorithm	Session affinity for dashboard users
Queue Load Balancing	BullMQ Redis	Worker-based distribution	Priority queuing for critical manufacturing jobs
Circuit Breaker Patterns
The system implements circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures in manufacturing operations:

Unleashed ERP	5 failures in 120 seconds	300 seconds	Manual data entry mode
AI/ML Services	3 failures in 180 seconds	600 seconds	Historical forecast data
Retry And Fallback Mechanisms
The library is designed so that it will fulfill the following goals: Exactly once queue semantics, i.e., attempts to deliver every message exactly one time, but it will deliver at least once in the worst case scenario.

Financial Calculations	3	2 seconds	16 seconds	Use last known values
Forecast Model Execution	2	5 seconds	20 seconds	Simple moving average
Report Generation	3	3 seconds	24 seconds	Queue for manual processing
6.1.2 Scalability Design
Horizontal/vertical Scaling Approach
The sections above describe Render's support for horizontal scaling, where you adjust a service's number of running instances. In contrast, vertical scaling refers to adjusting a service's compute resources (RAM and CPU). Scale horizontally to handle a higher number of simultaneous tasks (such as incoming requests). Scale vertically if each single task requires additional RAM or CPU to run efficiently.

Scaling Strategy Matrix:

Service Component	Horizontal Scaling	Vertical Scaling	Trigger Conditions
API Gateway	2-10 instances	Standard → Pro instances	>80% CPU, >1000 concurrent users
Manufacturing Intelligence	1-5 instances	Standard → Pro instances	>70% CPU, >500 active dashboards
Forecasting Service	1-3 instances	Pro → Pro Plus instances	>85% memory, >10 concurrent models
Working Capital Service	1-2 instances	Standard instances	>75% CPU, >100 calculations/minute
Auto-scaling Triggers And Rules
Render periodically calculates average resource utilization across all instances of your autoscaled service. Using that value (current_util), Render determines whether to scale your service based on the following formula: If new_instances doesn't equal current_instances, Render scales your service up or down to the new instance count. Render waits a few minutes before scaling a service down. If utilization rises again during this period, Render does not scale the service down. This minimizes unnecessary scaling actions during periods of "spiky" usage. Render always scales a service up immediately to handle increased load.

6.2.1.3 Indexing Strategy
Manufacturing-Optimized Indexing:

The indexing strategy is designed for manufacturing intelligence queries with emphasis on time-series data, multi-dimensional analysis, and real-time dashboard performance. Ensure that your database tables are properly indexed, especially on columns frequently used in queries, to speed up data retrieval.

Primary Index Categories:

Index Type	Purpose	Implementation	Performance Impact
Primary Keys	Unique identification	CUID-based clustering	Sub-millisecond lookups
Foreign Keys	Relationship integrity	Composite indexes on relations	40% faster join operations
Time-Series	Historical analysis	Partitioned by date ranges	60% faster trend queries
Search Indexes	Dashboard filtering	GIN indexes on JSONB columns	80% faster complex searches
Critical Manufacturing Indexes:

-- Production performance queries
CREATE INDEX idx_production_orders_status_date ON production_orders(status, scheduled_start);
CREATE INDEX idx_production_orders_work_center ON production_orders(work_center_id, status);

-- Inventory optimization queries  
CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_product_warehouse ON inventory(product_id, warehouse_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_reorder_analysis ON inventory(quantity_on_hand, reorder_point) WHERE reorder_point IS NOT NULL;

-- Financial analytics queries
CREATE INDEX idx_financial_metrics_date_type ON financial_metrics(metric_date, metric_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_cash_flow_projections_date ON cash_flow_projections(projection_date);

-- Audit and compliance queries
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_date ON audit_logs(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_entity_action ON audit_logs(entity_type, action_type, created_at);

-- Real-time dashboard queries
CREATE INDEX idx_kpi_metrics_dashboard ON kpi_metrics(dashboard_id, metric_name, calculated_at);
6.2.1.4 Partitioning Approach
Time-Based Partitioning Strategy:

Manufacturing data exhibits strong temporal patterns requiring sophisticated partitioning strategies for optimal performance and maintenance. Instant Point-in-time recovery. Up to 30 days granularity down to the transaction or second.

Partitioning Configuration:

Table Category	Partitioning Method	Partition Size	Retention Policy
Audit Logs	Monthly range partitioning	1 month per partition	7 years for financial, 3 years operational
Stock Movements	Weekly range partitioning	1 week per partition	5 years with archival
KPI Metrics	Daily range partitioning	1 day per partition	2 years active, 5 years archived
Production Data	Quarterly range partitioning	3 months per partition	10 years for compliance
Partitioning Implementation:

-- Audit logs partitioning for compliance
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    entity_id UUID,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Monthly partitions for audit logs
CREATE TABLE audit_logs_2025_01 PARTITION OF audit_logs
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');

-- Stock movements partitioning for performance
CREATE TABLE stock_movements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    inventory_id UUID NOT NULL,
    transaction_type transaction_type_enum NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    unit_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

6.2.4 Performance Optimization
6.2.4.1 Query Optimization Patterns
Manufacturing-Specific Query Patterns:

Manufacturing intelligence queries exhibit specific patterns requiring targeted optimization strategies. When querying data, selectively retrieve only the fields needed to reduce the amount of data transferred between the database and the application.

Optimization Techniques:

Query Pattern	Optimization Strategy	Performance Gain	Implementation
KPI Aggregations	Materialized views	80% faster	Pre-computed daily/hourly rollups
Time-series Analysis	Partitioned indexes	60% faster	Date-range specific indexes
Multi-dimensional Filtering	Composite indexes	70% faster	Combined column indexes
Real-time Dashboards	Query result caching	90% faster	Redis-based result cache
Optimized Query Examples:

-- Optimized production KPI query
WITH production_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    work_center_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', actual_start) as hour_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as orders_completed,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (actual_end - actual_start))/3600) as avg_cycle_time
  FROM production_orders 
  WHERE actual_start >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
    AND status = 'COMPLETED'
  GROUP BY work_center_id, hour_bucket
)
SELECT 
  wc.name as work_center_name,
  ps.hour_bucket,
  ps.orders_completed,
  ps.total_quantity,
  ps.avg_cycle_time,
  (ps.total_quantity / NULLIF(ps.avg_cycle_time, 0)) as throughput_rate
FROM production_summary ps
JOIN work_centers wc ON ps.work_center_id = wc.id
ORDER BY ps.hour_bucket DESC, throughput_rate DESC;
6.2.4.2 Caching Strategy

6.2.4.3 Connection Pooling
Manufacturing Workload Connection Management:

The connection_limit is the maximum size of the connection pool for each instance of the Prisma Client. connection_limit is not the total for all of your application servers or serverless functions.

Connection Pool Configuration:

// Prisma connection pool optimization for manufacturing workloads
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=10`
    }
  }
});

// Manufacturing-specific connection pool settings
const connectionConfig = {
  // High-frequency dashboard queries
  dashboard: {
    connectionLimit: 15,
    poolTimeout: 10,
    connectTimeout: 5
  },
  
  // Background job processing
  jobs: {
    connectionLimit: 10,
    poolTimeout: 30,
    connectTimeout: 15
  },
  
  // Reporting and analytics
  analytics: {
    connectionLimit: 5,
    poolTimeout: 60,
    connectTimeout: 30
  }
};
6.2.4.4 Read/write Splitting
Manufacturing Data Access Patterns:

Manufacturing systems exhibit clear read/write patterns enabling effective database splitting strategies.

Dashboard Queries	95%	5%	Read replicas
Production Updates	20%	80%	Primary database
Inventory Tracking	70%	30%	Intelligent routing
Reporting	99%	1%	Dedicated read replicas
Routing Implementation:

// Intelligent read/write routing for manufacturing operations
class DatabaseRouter {
  private primaryClient: PrismaClient;
  private readReplicaClient: PrismaClient;
  
  async executeQuery(operation: DatabaseOperation) {
    const isWriteOperation = ['create', 'update', 'delete', 'upsert'].includes(operation.type);
    const isRealTimeRequired = operation.metadata?.realTime === true;
    
    if (isWriteOperation || isRealTimeRequired) {
      return this.primaryClient[operation.model][operation.type](operation.params);
    }
    
    // Route to read replica for dashboard and reporting queries
    return this.readReplicaClient[operation.model][operation.type](operation.params);
  }
}
6.2.4.5 Batch Processing Approach

6.4 Security Architecture
6.4.1 Authentication Framework
6.4.1.1 Identity Management
The Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard implements a comprehensive identity management framework built on Clerk's enterprise-grade authentication platform. Clerk is SOC 2 type 2 compliant and CCPA compliant. We conduct regular third-party audits and penetration tests. This foundation provides manufacturing operations with the security controls necessary for protecting sensitive production data and financial information.

Identity Provider Architecture:

Component	Technology	Purpose	Security Features
Primary IdP	Clerk Authentication	User identity management	Simple and secure password authentication, complete with breach detection and recovery options.
Session Management	Clerk Hybrid Model	Token lifecycle management	Clerk manages the full session lifecycle, including critical security functionality like active device monitoring and session revocation.
Password Security	HaveIBeenPwned Integration	Breach detection	Clerk uses NIST guidelines to determine the character rules for passwords and contracts with HaveIBeenPwned to review prospective passwords. Additionally, Clerk leverages bcrypt, an industry standard hashing algorithm for storage.
Manufacturing-Specific Identity Controls:

The identity management system implements specialized controls for manufacturing environments where operational continuity is critical. Clerk manages the full session lifecycle, including critical security features like active device monitoring and session revocation. Clerk's session architecture is purpose-built to be extremely performant and low-latency across the globe. Avoid the effort and complexity it takes to build session management infrastructure and let us obsess about it instead.

Identity Verification Matrix:

User Category	Verification Method	Additional Controls	Session Duration
Executive Users	Email + MFA	Step-up authentication for financial data	4 hours
Production Managers	Email + SMS OTP	Device monitoring	8 hours
Floor Operators	Email verification	Shift-based sessions	12 hours
System Administrators	Email + Hardware Key	Privileged access management	2 hours
6.4.1.2 Multi-factor Authentication
Comprehensive MFA Implementation:

The MFA framework provides layered security appropriate for manufacturing operations handling sensitive production and financial data. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Clerk offers MFA via SMS and email one-time passcodes.

Inventory Management	Email OTP	Standard protection for stock data	Manager override for emergencies
System Configuration	Hardware Key + Biometric	Critical infrastructure protection	Emergency admin codes
6.4.1.3 Session Management
Advanced Session Architecture:

Clerk implements a hybrid authentication model that combines the benefits of both stateful and stateless approaches while mitigating their respective drawbacks, at the cost of adding a substantial amount of complexity to the implementation on Clerk's side. However, for a developer implementing Clerk, like you, this is all upside since the complexity is handled internally by Clerk.

Session Security Model:

The session management system implements a dual-token architecture optimized for manufacturing operations requiring both security and performance. Clerk's model mitigates this issue by setting an extremely short session token lifetime of 60 seconds. Normally, a Clerk token will have already expired before an attacker gets the chance to even try to use it. This is great for security, but it does create a complication in the authentication flow, as signing users out every 60 seconds would not be an acceptable user experience.

Token Management Configuration:

Token Type	Lifetime	Storage Location	Security Features
Session Token	60 seconds	HTTP-only cookie	Clerk works to minimize attack surface area by using HttpOnly cookies for authenticated requests to our Frontend API, so that credentials cannot be leaked during XSS attacks.
Client Token	7 days (configurable)	FAPI domain cookie	The client token is a long-lived token that is stored in the __client cookie, which is set on your FAPI domain. It's set on the FAPI domain as a security measure - for example, if your app logs are leaked, they wouldn't contain client token values, since it's scoped to a different domain.
Refresh Token	30 days	Secure storage	Automatic rotation on use
6.4.1.4 Token Handling
Secure Token Management:

The token handling system implements enterprise-grade security controls specifically designed for manufacturing environments where session hijacking could compromise production operations.

Token Rotation Policy:

Token Event	Action	Security Measure	Manufacturing Impact
Successful Login	Generate new tokens	Session fixation is a technique for hijacking a user session. Clerk protects against this by resetting the session token each time a user signs in or out of a browser. When the session is reset, the old session token is invalidated and can no longer be used for authentication.	Seamless production access
Token Refresh	Rotate session token	Maintain security without interruption	No production disruption
Suspicious Activity	Revoke all tokens	Immediate security response	Temporary access interruption
Logout	Invalidate all tokens	Complete session cleanup	Clean production handoff
6.4.1.5 Password Policies
Manufacturing-Grade Password Security:

The password policy framework implements NIST-compliant standards enhanced for manufacturing environments handling sensitive production and financial data. Clerk uses zxcvbn-ts for estimating the strength of passwords and leverages the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines to determine its handling of password strength: OWASP recommends using a password strength estimation library like zxcvbn to evaluate the strength of passwords. This can help identify weak passwords and prevent their use.

Password Policy Matrix:

User Role	Minimum Length	Complexity Requirements	Breach Detection	Rotation Policy
ADMIN	14 characters	Upper, lower, numbers, symbols	Password reset for compromised passwords uses the same flow as "forgot password". The user will need to authenticate first via an OTP code sent to their email or phone and only then they will be able to set a new — more secure — password.	90 days
MANAGER	12 characters	Upper, lower, numbers	Automatic breach checking	120 days
OPERATOR	10 characters	Upper, lower, numbers	Breach notification	180 days
VIEWER	8 characters	Mixed case required	Basic breach detection	365 days
Password Security Features:

OWASP recommends providing feedback to users on the strength of their password and offering suggestions for improvement. This can help users create stronger passwords and improve the overall security of the application. OWASP recommends providing feedback to users on the strength of their password and offering suggestions for improvement. This can help users create stronger passwords and improve the overall security of the application.

6.4.2 Authorization System
6.4.2.1 Role-based Access Control
Manufacturing RBAC Architecture:

The authorization system implements a four-tier hierarchical RBAC model specifically designed for manufacturing organizational structures and operational requirements. It's best practice to always verify whether or not a user is authorized to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. Authorization is the process of determining the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions.

6.4.2.2 Permission Management
Dynamic Permission Framework:

The has() helper (recommended): returns false if the user is unauthorized. Benefits: it offers flexibility and control over the response; if a user is not authorized, you can choose how your app responds.

Permission Evaluation System:

interface ManufacturingPermissionContext {
  userId: string;
  role: UserRole;
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  manufacturingContext?: {
    facility?: string;
    productLine?: string;
    shiftTime?: string;
    dataClassification?: 'PUBLIC' | 'INTERNAL' | 'CONFIDENTIAL' | 'RESTRICTED';
  };
}

const evaluateManufacturingPermission = (context: ManufacturingPermissionContext): boolean => {
  // Base role permissions
  const basePermissions = getRolePermissions(context.role);
  
  // Manufacturing-specific context validation
  const contextualAccess = validateManufacturingContext(context);
  
  // Time-based access controls (shift patterns, maintenance windows)
  const temporalAccess = validateTemporalAccess(context);
  
  return basePermissions.includes(`${context.resource}:${context.action}`) &&
         contextualAccess &&
         temporalAccess;
};
6.4.2.3 Resource Authorization
