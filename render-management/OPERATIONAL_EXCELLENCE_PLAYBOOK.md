## üö® Incident Response Procedures

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Example |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Complete outage | 15 minutes | All services down |
| **P2 - High** | Degraded service | 30 minutes | Database connection issues |
| **P3 - Medium** | Feature impaired | 2 hours | Slow response times |
| **P4 - Low** | Minor issue | Next business day | UI glitch |

### P1 Critical Incident Response

#### 1. Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)
```powershell
# Rapid assessment
$critical_services = @(
    @{Name="Production"; URL="https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/health"},
    @{Name="Database"; URL="https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/api/health/db"},
    @{Name="MCP Server"; URL="https://mcp-server-tkyu.onrender.com/health"}
)

foreach ($service in $critical_services) {
    try {
        Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $service.URL -TimeoutSec 3
        Write-Host "‚úÖ $($service.Name): UP" -ForegroundColor Green
    } catch {
        Write-Host "‚ùå $($service.Name): DOWN" -ForegroundColor Red
        # Trigger alert
    }
}
```

#### 2. Diagnosis (5-15 minutes)
```powershell
# Gather evidence
.\get-logs.ps1 -ServiceName "sentia-manufacturing-production" -Lines 200 | Out-File "incident-logs.txt"

# Check recent deployments
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
$deployments = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services/deployments?limit=5" -Headers $headers

# Check external dependencies
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "api.render.com" -Port 443
```

#### 3. Resolution (15+ minutes)
```powershell
# Option 1: Restart service (via Dashboard)
Start-Process "https://dashboard.render.com/web/services"

# Option 2: Rollback (if deployment-related)
# Use Render Dashboard rollback feature

# Option 3: Scale up (if resource issue)
# Adjust via Render Dashboard
```

#### 4. Post-Incident (After resolution)
```powershell
# Document incident
$incident = @{
    ID = "INC-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss')"
    Severity = "P1"
    StartTime = ""
    EndTime = ""
    Duration = ""
    RootCause = ""
    Resolution = ""
    PreventiveMeasures = ""
}

$incident | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "incidents\$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')-incident.json"
```

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Weekly Metrics to Track

```powershell
# Weekly KPI collector
$kpis = @{
    Week = Get-Date -UFormat "%V"
    Uptime = 0
    IncidentCount = 0
    AverageResponseTime = 0
    DeploymentSuccess = 0
    ErrorRate = 0
}

# Calculate uptime
$totalMinutes = 7 * 24 * 60
$downtime = 0  # Get from incident logs
$kpis.Uptime = (($totalMinutes - $downtime) / $totalMinutes) * 100

Write-Host "Week $($kpis.Week) Uptime: $($kpis.Uptime)%"
```

### Target KPIs
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%
- **MTTR**: < 30 minutes
- **Deployment Success**: > 95%

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Opportunities

### 1. Automated Health Monitor
```powershell
# Save as automated-monitor.ps1
param(
    [int]$IntervalSeconds = 300
)

while ($true) {
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    $health = @{}

    $services = @(
        "sentia-manufacturing-production",
        "sentia-manufacturing-testing",
        "sentia-mcp-server"
    )

    foreach ($service in $services) {
        try {
            $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://$service.onrender.com/health" -TimeoutSec 5
            $health[$service] = "Healthy"
        } catch {
            $health[$service] = "Unhealthy"
            # Send alert
            Send-MailMessage -To "ops@sentia.com" -Subject "Service Down: $service" -Body "Service $service is not responding"
        }
    }

    # Log results
    "$timestamp - $($health | ConvertTo-Json -Compress)" | Add-Content "monitoring.log"

    Start-Sleep -Seconds $IntervalSeconds
}
```

### 2. Deployment Verifier
```powershell
# Save as verify-deployment.ps1
param(
    [string]$ServiceName
)

Write-Host "Verifying deployment for $ServiceName..." -ForegroundColor Yellow

# Pre-deployment metrics
$preMetrics = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://$ServiceName.onrender.com/metrics"

# Wait for deployment (check Render API)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 120

# Post-deployment checks
$checks = @{
    HealthCheck = $false
    ResponseTime = 0
    ErrorRate = 0
    Version = ""
}

# Health check
try {
    $health = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://$ServiceName.onrender.com/health"
    $checks.HealthCheck = $true
    $checks.Version = $health.version
} catch {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Health check failed" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Response time
$checks.ResponseTime = (Measure-Command {
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://$ServiceName.onrender.com"
}).TotalMilliseconds

# Compare with pre-deployment
if ($checks.ResponseTime -gt ($preMetrics.ResponseTime * 1.5)) {
    Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è Response time degraded" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}

$checks | Format-Table
```

## üìà Scaling Guidelines

### When to Scale

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| CPU > 80% | 5 minutes | Scale horizontally |
| Memory > 85% | 10 minutes | Scale vertically |
| Response time > 1s | 15 minutes | Add instances |
| Queue depth > 1000 | Immediate | Add workers |

### Scaling Procedures

```powershell
# Check current resources
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
$service = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-xxxxx" -Headers $headers

Write-Host "Current plan: $($service.plan)"
Write-Host "Instances: $($service.numInstances)"

# Scale via Dashboard (API scaling coming soon)
Start-Process "https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-xxxxx/settings"
```

---

## üîê Security Operations

### Weekly Security Tasks

```powershell
# 1. Check for unusual API activity
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $env:RENDER_API_KEY"}
$logs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/audit-logs" -Headers $headers

# 2. Review access patterns
$logs | Where-Object {$_.action -match "login|auth"} |
    Group-Object -Property user |
    Select-Object Count, Name

# 3. Verify environment variables
$services = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services" -Headers $headers
foreach ($service in $services) {
    if ($service.envVars -match "KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD") {
        Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è Check secrets in $($service.name)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}
```
