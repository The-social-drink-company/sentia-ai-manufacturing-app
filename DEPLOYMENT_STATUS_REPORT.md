# Deployment Status Report
**Date**: 2025-10-20 00:00 UTC
**Reporter**: Codex (BMAD Developer Agent)
**Update**: Backend deployment remains unhealthy; remediation required before further Render attempts.

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status**: BLOCKED - Backend failing, frontend waiting on Clerk key and healthy API, MCP not re-verified.

| Component    | Status          | Health | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Frontend     | Needs config    | Blocked pending Clerk key | Set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY after backend is stable; redeploy afterwards |
| Backend API  | Unhealthy       | Connection aborted | Prisma schema gaps (adminApproval, working-capital) and failing vitest suites prevent successful deploy |
| MCP Server   | Unknown (last 200 OK on 2025-10-19) | Re-check pending | Re-run health checks once backend redeploy succeeds |
| Git Repo     | Dirty workspace | main | Local tree has uncommitted changes (see git status); no new commits pushed |
| BMAD Story   | Blocked         | n/a | BMAD-INFRA-004 remains open; acceptance criteria unmet |

## Findings (2025-10-20 Audit)

- Render backend `/api/health` request terminated with connection aborted (see bmad/status/2025-10-20-project-review.md).
- vitest suite still failing (7 suites / 41 tests) - queue monitor and admin services rely on missing data layer.
- Admin controllers continue to return 501 placeholders; Prisma models for adminApproval and related records absent.
- Documentation previously stated 95% deployment readiness; updated BMAD status now flags blockers.

## Outstanding Actions

1. Define required Prisma models/migrations (adminApproval, working-capital records, queue monitors) and update services.
2. Repair vitest suites and ensure queue monitor/admin tests pass locally.
3. Re-run Render backend deployment (safe migrate + service restart) and confirm `/api/health` = 200 OK.
4. After backend stability, configure `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` on frontend service and trigger redeploy.
5. Re-verify MCP health endpoints and capture evidence (curl/screenshots) for BMAD documentation.

**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: Dependent on data-layer implementation (multi-day)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] vitest --run passes locally
- [ ] prisma migrate deploy executed successfully on Render
- [ ] Backend `/api/health` returns 200 OK (Render dashboard + external curl)
- [ ] Frontend loads without Clerk configuration errors
- [ ] MCP `/health` returns 200 OK
- [ ] BMAD status documents updated with final outcomes
