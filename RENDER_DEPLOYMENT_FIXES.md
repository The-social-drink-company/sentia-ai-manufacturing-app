# Render Deployment Fixes - September 2025

## Issues Identified
The Render deployments were returning HTML (index.html) instead of JSON for API requests, causing the application to show "502 Bad Gateway" errors and services to appear disconnected.

## Root Causes
1. **Static file middleware interference**: Express.static was serving index.html for API routes
2. **Missing CORS origins**: Testing environment URL not included in CORS configuration
3. **Health endpoint conflicts**: Multiple health endpoints causing confusion
4. **Route ordering issues**: Static file serving potentially intercepting API requests

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Express Route Handling (server.js)
- **Added protection middleware** before express.static to skip API routes
- **Disabled directory indexing** with `index: false` option
- **Ensured API routes bypass static file handling** completely

```javascript
// Protection middleware added at line 5719
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api/') || req.path === '/health') {
    return next('route'); // Skip static middleware for API routes
  }
  next();
});

// Static middleware updated with index:false at line 5732
app.use(express.static(join(__dirname, 'dist'), {
  index: false, // Prevent serving index.html for directories
  // ... other options
}));
```

### 2. Updated CORS Configuration (server.js)
- **Added all Render environments** to allowed origins
- **Implemented dynamic CORS** to allow any .onrender.com domain
- **Added testing environment** explicitly

```javascript
// CORS updated at line 502
app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // Dynamic CORS to allow all Render deployments
    if (!origin || origin.includes('.onrender.com') || origin.includes('localhost')) {
      callback(null, true);
    }
    // ... rest of logic
  }
}));
```

### 3. Consolidated Health Endpoints (server.js)
- **Single main /health endpoint** for Render health checks (line 1076)
- **Moved detailed checks** to /health/detailed endpoint
- **Simplified response** that doesn't depend on external services

```javascript
// Main health endpoint at line 1076
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    server: 'sentia-manufacturing',
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
    render: !!process.env.RENDER
  });
});
```

### 4. Database Connection Handling (lib/prisma.js)
- Already has **graceful fallback** for missing DATABASE_URL
- **Mock Prisma client** prevents crashes when database unavailable
- **Detailed error diagnostics** for troubleshooting

## Testing
Created test script: `scripts/test-render-fixes.js`

Test the fixes after deployment:
```bash
# Test development environment
node scripts/test-render-fixes.js development

# Test testing environment
node scripts/test-render-fixes.js testing

# Test production environment
node scripts/test-render-fixes.js production
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit the changes**:
```bash
git add server.js lib/prisma.js scripts/test-render-fixes.js RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md
git commit -m "fix: Resolve Render API routing issues - endpoints now return JSON instead of HTML"
```

2. **Push to development branch** (auto-deploys to Render):
```bash
git push origin development
```

3. **Monitor deployment**:
- Check Render dashboard for deployment progress
- Wait for "Live" status
- Run test script to verify fixes

4. **If successful on development**, promote to testing:
```bash
git checkout test
git merge development
git push origin test
```

5. **After UAT on testing**, promote to production:
```bash
git checkout production
git merge test
git push origin production
```

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] /health endpoint returns JSON with status: 'healthy'
- [ ] /api/health returns JSON health check data
- [ ] /api/dashboard/overview returns dashboard JSON data
- [ ] /api/working-capital/overview returns financial JSON data
- [ ] No HTML responses for API endpoints
- [ ] Services show as "connected" in dashboard
- [ ] No 502 Bad Gateway errors

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist after deployment:
1. Revert the commit: `git revert HEAD`
2. Push to trigger redeployment
3. Investigate logs in Render dashboard
4. Check environment variables are properly set

## Additional Notes
- The fixes are backward compatible and won't affect local development
- Database connection is now more resilient with fallback handling
- Health checks are simplified for faster response times
- CORS is more flexible for Render deployments while maintaining security
