# BMAD Action Log - 2025-10-21

## Context
- Server boot was blocked because /server/routes/api.js was missing; restored consolidated router and captured work in bmad/status/daily-log.md.
- Critical blockers remain around data-layer alignment (missing Prisma models vs. service queries) and failing automated suites documented in BMAD-METHOD-V6A-IMPLEMENTATION.md and bmad/status/2025-10-20-project-review.md.

## Next Actions
1. **Prisma/Data Layer Alignment**
   - Define schema models for inventory, warehouse, revenue, and other tables referenced by services and seeds (server/api/real-api.js, server/api/working-capital.js, prisma/seed.ts).
   - Generate migrations and update seed script to match the new models.
   - Owners: BMAD data engineering track.
2. **Admin/API Implementation**
   - Replace 501 placeholders in admin controllers (server/controllers/admin/*.js) with functional logic once data layer is available.
   - Wire MFA verification and audit persistence.
3. **Automated Test Recovery**
   - Repair Vitest suites (41 current failures) and update Playwright scenarios per BMAD-METHOD-V6A-IMPLEMENTATION.md notes.
   - Ensure new /server/routes/api.js coverage is added to regression tests.
4. **Deployment Readiness**
   - After tests pass, rerun Render backend deployment and confirm /api/health responds 200.
   - Only then re-attempt frontend deployment with Clerk keys set.

## Tracking
- Update BMAD-METHOD-V6A-IMPLEMENTATION.md once the data layer work begins so Phase 4 blockers reflect active remediation.
- Next status checkpoint: add verification notes to bmad/status/daily-log.md after delivering each action.
