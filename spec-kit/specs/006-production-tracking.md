# Feature Specification: Production Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `006-production-tracking`
**Created**: September 26, 2025
**Status**: In Development
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive production tracking system with real-time OEE monitoring, production scheduling, machine status tracking, quality control, capacity planning, and shift management for manufacturing operations"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted: OEE monitoring, production scheduling, machine status, quality control
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Production Manager, Line Supervisor, Operator, Maintenance Staff, Quality Inspector
   → Actions: monitor, schedule, track, control, plan, handover, alert
   → Data: OEE metrics, machine status, production jobs, quality metrics, capacity
   → Constraints: real-time accuracy, shift continuity, safety compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → OEE calculation: Availability × Performance × Quality
   → Machine states: Running, Idle, Down, Maintenance, Setup
   → Production metrics: Throughput, cycle time, yield, efficiency
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear workflow: Monitor OEE → track jobs → manage quality → plan capacity
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement measurable and testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Machines, jobs, shifts, quality metrics, maintenance events
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear and unambiguous
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Production Manager, I need comprehensive visibility into real-time production performance, machine status, and quality metrics to optimize efficiency, prevent downtime, maintain quality standards, and ensure smooth shift transitions for continuous manufacturing operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** real-time machine data, **When** viewing the production dashboard, **Then** I see current OEE metrics with availability, performance, and quality breakdowns within 5 seconds
2. **Given** production schedule data, **When** monitoring job progress, **Then** the system shows actual vs planned progress with variance analysis and completion forecasts
3. **Given** machine status changes, **When** equipment goes offline, **Then** automated alerts are sent to maintenance staff with downtime classification
4. **Given** quality inspection results, **When** defects are detected, **Then** the system triggers quality hold procedures and calculates impact on OEE
5. **Given** shift change requirements, **When** completing handover, **Then** all critical information is documented and transferred to incoming shift
6. **Given** capacity constraints, **When** scheduling new jobs, **Then** the system validates resource availability and suggests optimal scheduling

### Edge Cases
- What happens when machines lose connectivity? → Offline mode with data buffering and sync when connection restored
- How does the system handle emergency stops? → Immediate safety protocol activation with incident logging
- What if quality metrics fall below thresholds? → Automatic production halt with quality investigation workflow
- How to manage unplanned maintenance? → Dynamic rescheduling with impact analysis and stakeholder notifications
