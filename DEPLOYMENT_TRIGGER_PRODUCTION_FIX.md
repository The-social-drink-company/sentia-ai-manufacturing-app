# Production Deployment Fix

**Date:** 2025-09-20  
**Time:** 16:35 UTC  
**Issue:** 502 Bad Gateway on production deployment  
**Solution:** Simplified production server implementation  

## Changes Made

1. **Created simplified production server** (`production-server-simple.js`)
   - Minimal dependencies and initialization
   - Focus on serving static files and basic API endpoints
   - Removed complex enterprise initialization that may cause startup timeouts

2. **Updated package.json scripts**
   - Changed start command to use simplified server
   - Kept backup options for complex server

3. **Updated render.yaml configuration**
   - All environments now use the simplified production server
   - Maintained all environment variables and database connections

## Expected Result

The simplified server should resolve the 502 Bad Gateway error by:
- Faster startup time (no complex initialization)
- Reduced memory usage during startup
- Fewer potential failure points
- Maintained core functionality for static file serving

## Deployment Trigger

This file serves as a deployment trigger for Render to rebuild the production environment with the new simplified server configuration.

**Trigger ID:** PROD-FIX-20250920-1635
