## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Finance Manager, I need comprehensive visibility into our working capital components to identify optimization opportunities, reduce cash tied up in operations, and improve our cash conversion cycle while maintaining healthy supplier relationships and customer satisfaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a finance user accessing the dashboard, **When** they load the working capital page, **Then** they see current AR, AP, and inventory positions within 3 seconds
2. **Given** receivables data is available, **When** the user views AR aging, **Then** they see invoices categorized by age buckets with drill-down capability
3. **Given** payables are due, **When** the user accesses payment planning, **Then** they see optimized payment schedules considering discounts and cash availability
4. **Given** inventory data exists, **When** analyzing turnover, **Then** the system displays turnover ratios by category with trend analysis
5. **Given** historical data is available, **When** requesting forecasts, **Then** the system generates 30/60/90-day cash flow projections
6. **Given** optimization rules are configured, **When** the system analyzes data, **Then** it provides ranked recommendations with quantified impact

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external data sync fails? → Display last sync timestamp with manual refresh option
- How does the system handle currency conversions? → Real-time rates with configurable fallback rates
- What if payment terms conflict? → Prioritization matrix based on business rules
- How to handle partial payments? → Pro-rated aging with allocation rules
