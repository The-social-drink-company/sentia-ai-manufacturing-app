# Repository Reset Log â€“ 2025-09-25

## Overview

To resolve widespread ESLint and Prettier violations that accumulated in the prior codebase, we created a fresh clone of the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard repository on 2025-09-25. This reset provides a clean baseline for linting, formatting, and future feature work.

## Previous State

- Persistent lint errors across legacy files blocked automated checks.
- Prettier formatting drift made diffs noisy and hard to review.
- Pipeline safeguards (lint/typecheck) were unreliable because the default branch failed locally.

## Actions Taken

- Archived the previous repository state and captured open work items.
- Cloned a clean copy of the upstream repository.
- Re-applied required configuration and documentation assets (context, SpecKit, MCP scripts).
- Re-validated tooling: `pm run lint`, `pm run typecheck`, and `pm run format:check` now pass on the new baseline.

## Current Status

- Active development continues in the refreshed repository.
- Context documentation and SpecKit guides now reference the new baseline.
- Legacy lint exceptions should be reintroduced only after review and justification.

## Follow-Up Tasks

1. Audit remaining feature branches for compatibility with the new baseline.
2. Restore only the necessary legacy code paths, ensuring they meet lint and formatting standards.
3. Monitor CI for any regressions triggered by the repository reset.

## Reference

- Reset triggered by: development team maintenance (2025-09-25)
- Reason: unblock linting and formatting workflows.
