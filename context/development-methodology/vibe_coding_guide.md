# Development Methodology: Vibe Coding

## Core Principle

You will receive comprehensive sequential development prompts that build the entire
application using scaffolding and Lego block methodology. Your job is to:

1. Execute each prompt exactly as specified
2. Maintain strict context references
3. Debug and fix any errors
4. Request additional prompts for gaps

## Critical Success Factor: Prevent AI Drift

- Always reference specific context folders/files in every interaction with Claude
- Never search the entire codebase - use structured context references
- Validate context understanding before proceeding with each prompt
