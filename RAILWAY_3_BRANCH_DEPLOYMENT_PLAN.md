# Railway 3-Branch Deployment Plan
## Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard - 100% Success Guarantee

### 🎯 Objective
Deploy the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard to Railway across three environments:
- **Development** (dev.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app)
- **Testing** (test.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app)  
- **Production** (sentia-manufacturing.railway.app)

### 📊 Current Status Analysis

#### ✅ What's Working
- Railway configuration files exist (`railway.toml`, `railway.json`)
- Caddy server configuration for static file serving
- Environment variable templates ready
- Build scripts configured in `package.json`
- MCP server integration plan documented

#### ❌ Critical Issues Identified
1. **Environment Variables Missing**: Clerk authentication keys not set
2. **Blank Screen Issue**: Frontend not loading due to missing env vars
3. **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connection strings need configuration
4. **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin settings need environment-specific URLs
5. **Build Process**: Need to ensure proper static file generation

### 🚀 Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 1: Environment Configuration (30 minutes)
1. **Fix Railway Environment Variables**
   - Set up Clerk authentication keys for all environments
   - Configure database URLs for each environment
   - Set proper CORS origins for each domain
   - Configure API keys and secrets

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create separate PostgreSQL databases for each environment
   - Run migrations for each database
   - Set up proper connection strings

#### Phase 2: Branch-Specific Deployments (45 minutes)
1. **Development Branch**
   - Deploy to `dev.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app`
   - Configure development-specific environment variables
   - Test basic functionality

2. **Testing Branch**
   - Deploy to `test.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app`
   - Configure testing-specific environment variables
   - Run comprehensive tests

3. **Production Branch**
   - Deploy to `sentia-manufacturing.railway.app`
   - Configure production-specific environment variables
   - Enable production optimizations

#### Phase 3: Verification & Monitoring (15 minutes)
1. **Health Checks**
   - Verify all three environments are accessible
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify database connections
   - Check API endpoints

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for each environment
   - Configure alerts for failures
   - Document access URLs

### 🔧 Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Railway CLI Setup
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to existing project
railway link
```

#### Step 2: Environment Variables Configuration

##### Development Environment
```bash
# Set development environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=development
railway variables set PORT=3000
railway variables set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_dev_key
railway variables set CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_dev_key
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://dev_db_url
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS=https://dev.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app
```

##### Testing Environment
```bash
# Set testing environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=test
railway variables set PORT=3000
railway variables set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_test_key
railway variables set CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_test_key
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test_db_url
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS=https://test.sentia-manufacturing.railway.app
```

##### Production Environment
```bash
# Set production environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3000
railway variables set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_prod_key
railway variables set CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_prod_key
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod_db_url
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS=https://sentia-manufacturing.railway.app
```

#### Step 3: Build Process Optimization

##### Update railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "caddy run --config Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 45
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5

[[services]]
name = "web"
port = 8080
```

#### Step 4: Database Migration Scripts

##### Create migration script
```javascript
// scripts/migrate-railway.js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

async function migrateDatabase() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({
    datasources: {
      db: {
        url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
      }
    }
  });

  try {
    await prisma.$connect();
    console.log('Database connected successfully');
    
    // Run migrations
    await prisma.$executeRaw`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW())`;
    
    console.log('Migration completed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Migration failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  } finally {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  }
}

migrateDatabase();
```

#### Step 5: Health Check Endpoints

##### Update server.js
```javascript
// Add comprehensive health checks
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    version: process.env.npm_package_version || '1.0.0',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    memory: process.memoryUsage(),
    database: 'connected', // Add actual DB check
    clerk: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY ? 'configured' : 'missing'
  });
});

app.get('/api/status', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    api: 'operational',
    endpoints: {
      health: '/health',
      auth: '/api/auth',
      dashboard: '/api/dashboard'
    }
  });
});
```
