# Render Recovery & Status Plan

## Goal

Advance bmad/stories/2025-10-bmad-infra-004-pgvector-extension-compatibility.md to completion by gathering current delivery status, coordinating Render-side migration resolution, and synchronizing BMAD documentation.

## Steps

1. Baseline Status Audit - Refresh git log/head, outstanding PRs, and Render health checks; capture findings in DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md and RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md.
2. Documentation Sync - Update BMAD story and supporting status docs (bmad/stories/...pgvector-extension-compatibility.md, bmad/status/2025-10-20-project-review.md) with current blockers, BMAD action log, and remediation ownership.
3. Render Remediation Coordination - Prepare/issue the Render shell command sequence (prisma migrate resolve/status, redeploy, health verification), record outcomes or blockers directly in the story and deployment docs.
4. Closure & Handover - Once health is 200 and docs are updated, mark acceptance criteria complete in the story, note completion in BMAD-METHOD-V6A-IMPLEMENTATION.md, and summarize next BMAD actions.

### To-dos

- [x] Collect git/PR/deploy health status and note in deployment docs (2025-10-19 19:40 UTC - see DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md)
- [x] Refresh BMAD story and status documents with audited findings and planned remediation (2025-10-19 19:40 UTC updates applied)
- [ ] Define Prisma schema/migrations for adminApproval, working-capital records, and queue monitors; update services before next deploy
- [ ] Coordinate Render migration resolve/deploy steps and document results (blocked until schema and vitest repairs)
- [ ] Confirm acceptance criteria, update BMAD trackers, and mark story complete (requires backend /api/health = 200 OK)
