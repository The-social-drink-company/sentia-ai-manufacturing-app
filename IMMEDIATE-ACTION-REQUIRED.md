# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED üö®

## Production is DOWN - 502 Error

### ‚è∞ Current Time: 6:19 PM
### üìä Status: WAITING FOR YOUR ACTION

---

## THE ONLY THING PREVENTING PRODUCTION FROM WORKING:

### ‚ùå Missing Clerk Environment Variables in Render

---

## üî¥ ACTION NEEDED NOW:

### Step 1: Open Render Dashboard
**URL**: https://dashboard.render.com

### Step 2: Find Production Service
**Service Name**: sentia-manufacturing-production

### Step 3: Go to Environment Tab
Click on "Environment" in the left sidebar

### Step 4: Add These Variables (COPY & PASTE EXACTLY):

```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_Y2xlcmsuZmluYW5jZWZsby5haSQ
```

```
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_mzgSFm1q9VrzngMMaCTNNwPEqBmr75vVxiND1DO7wq
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_Y2xlcmsuZmluYW5jZWZsby5haSQ
```

```
VITE_CLERK_DOMAIN=clerk.financeflo.ai
```

```
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_iTUcbgzS5P6zJlXWQkc4zGHnw8yLGt9j
```

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

```
API_BASE_URL=/api
```

### Step 5: Click "Save Changes"

## ‚úÖ WHAT WILL HAPPEN:

1. **Immediately**: Render triggers new deployment
2. **2-3 minutes**: Build runs
3. **3-5 minutes**: Service restarts
4. **5 minutes**: Production is LIVE!

---

## üìä MONITORING:

I have a monitor running that checks every 30 seconds.
As soon as production comes online, I'll notify you.

**Current Status**:
- Last check: 18:19:12
- Result: Still 502 (waiting for env vars)

---

## üí° WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:

Without these Clerk authentication keys:
- ‚ùå Server cannot start
- ‚ùå React app cannot load
- ‚ùå Authentication fails
- ‚ùå Result: 502 error

With these keys added:
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully
- ‚úÖ React app loads
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ Production is restored!

---

## üÜò IF YOU'RE STUCK:

**Can't access Render?**
- Check your login credentials
- Make sure you have access to the production service

**Don't see Environment tab?**
- You might not have permissions
- Contact your Render admin

**Variables already there?**
- Double-check the variable names (exact match)
- Ensure no typos in the values
- Try manual deployment trigger

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME ESTIMATE:

- Adding variables: 2 minutes
- Deployment: 3-5 minutes
- **Total time to fix: 5-7 minutes**

---

# üëâ GO TO RENDER NOW: https://dashboard.render.com

**The monitoring is running. As soon as you add the variables and production comes online, I'll confirm it!**
