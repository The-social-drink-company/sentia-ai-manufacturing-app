## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a manufacturing dashboard user, I need a responsive navigation system that adapts to my role and provides quick access to all dashboard features, so I can efficiently monitor and manage operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user with Manager role, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see production-focused navigation items and widgets
2. **Given** a user on mobile device, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** the sidebar collapses automatically and is accessible via hamburger menu
3. **Given** a user with saved layout preferences, **When** they return to the dashboard, **Then** their custom widget arrangement is restored
4. **Given** MCP server is unavailable, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** mock data is displayed with a connection warning
5. **Given** a user pressing G+F keys, **When** on any dashboard page, **Then** they navigate to the Forecasting page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user's role changes mid-session? Dashboard refreshes with new permissions
- How does system handle lost connection? Displays offline indicator, caches last data, auto-reconnects
- What if user has no permissions? Shows minimal read-only dashboard with support contact
