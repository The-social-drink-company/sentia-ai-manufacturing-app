# Stash Review - 2025-10-19

## Target Stash
- ID: stash@{0}
- Label: WIP: Unrelated changes before BMAD-CLEAN-001 merge
- Base Branch: main

## Files Touched
- .claude/settings.local.json (local preference change)
- services/__tests__/ai-forecasting-engine.cache.test.js (marked suite as skipped because @tensorflow/tfjs-node missing)
- src/pages/LandingPage.jsx (aliased `motion` import as `Motion` for linting)

## Disposition
- LandingPage adjustments already applied on main working tree.
- Test skip no longer needed; the test file was deleted in latest cleanup.
- .claude settings should remain unstashed (developer-local).

âœ… Safe to drop stash@{0}; no unique work remains.
