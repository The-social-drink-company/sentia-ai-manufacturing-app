## 🛠️ CLAUDE CODE CLI IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Cursor IDE Setup for Optimal Claude Code CLI Usage**

#### **1. Project Configuration**

```json
// .cursor/settings.json
{
  "claude.model": "claude-3-sonnet",
  "claude.maxTokens": 4000,
  "claude.temperature": 0.1,
  "claude.contextFiles": [
    "CLAUDE_CODE_CLI_TRANSFER_DOCUMENT.md",
    "enterprise_implementation_plan.md",
    "package.json",
    "server.js",
    "app.js"
  ]
}
```

#### **2. Effective Prompting Strategies**

```
"Analyze [specific component/file] focusing on [specific aspects].
Provide detailed findings with:
1. Current state assessment
2. Issues identified
3. Improvement recommendations
4. Implementation priority
5. Potential risks"
```

**For Implementation Tasks:**

```
"Implement [specific feature/fix] that:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]
Include error handling, logging, and tests."
```

**For Optimization Tasks:**

```
"Optimize [specific component] for:
1. Performance (response time, throughput)
2. Scalability (concurrent users, data volume)
3. Reliability (error handling, recovery)
4. Maintainability (code quality, documentation)
Provide before/after metrics."
```

#### **3. Context Management**

- **Always include** the transfer document in context
- **Reference specific files** when asking for analysis
- **Provide current metrics** when asking for optimization
- **Include error logs** when debugging issues
- **Specify target outcomes** clearly in prompts

#### **4. Iterative Development Approach**

1. **Analyze** → Use Claude to understand current state
2. **Plan** → Get Claude's recommendations for implementation
3. **Implement** → Use Claude to write/modify code
4. **Test** → Validate changes work correctly
5. **Optimize** → Use Claude to improve performance
6. **Document** → Update documentation with changes
