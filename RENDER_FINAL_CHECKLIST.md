# Push to development
git push origin development

# Create/update other branches
git checkout -b test
git merge development
git push origin test

git checkout -b production
git merge development
git push origin production
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render Dashboard

2. [ ] Click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Blueprint"**
3. [ ] Select repository: `The-social-drink-company/sentia-manufacturing-dashboard`
4. [ ] Choose file: `render-environments-complete.yaml`
5. [ ] Click **"Apply"**
6. [ ] Wait for all services to deploy (10-15 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Validate environment variables
npm run render:validate

# Check all deployments
npm run render:verify

# Health check all environments
npm run render:health
```

### Step 4: Migrate Data from Neon

#### For Each Environment:

1. [ ] **Development Database**

   ```bash
   # Windows
   npm run render:migrate:win
   # Mac/Linux
