# TestArch Automate Workflow - Validation Checklist

## Test Execution Validation

### Unit Tests
- [ ] All unit tests executed successfully
- [ ] No failing unit tests
- [ ] No skipped tests that should be running
- [ ] Unit test execution time is reasonable (<5 minutes)
- [ ] All new features have corresponding unit tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Integration tests executed (if mode >= standard)
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] External service mocks properly configured
- [ ] Database integration tests use test database
- [ ] Integration tests clean up after themselves

### E2E Tests
- [ ] E2E tests executed (if mode == full or ci_cd)
- [ ] All critical user flows tested
- [ ] E2E tests run in isolated environment
- [ ] Browser automation configured correctly
- [ ] E2E tests have reasonable timeout settings

## Architecture Compliance Validation

### Mock Data Elimination
- [ ] No hard-coded mock data in production source files
- [ ] No Math.random() usage in production code
- [ ] No faker.js imports outside of test files

- [ ] API services return real data or proper error states

### Error Handling
- [ ] All API calls wrapped in try/catch or .catch()
- [ ] Error logging implemented for all failures
- [ ] User-facing error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] No stack traces exposed to end users in production
- [ ] Timeout handling implemented for external calls

### Type Safety
- [ ] All .ts/.tsx files have proper TypeScript types
- [ ] All .js/.jsx files have JSDoc comments on exported functions
- [ ] Function parameters have type annotations
- [ ] Return types are documented
- [ ] No 'any' types used without justification

### External Integration Fallbacks
- [ ] Xero integration has graceful fallback when unavailable
- [ ] Shopify integration handles API rate limits
- [ ] Amazon SP-API has timeout and retry logic
- [ ] Unleashed ERP has authentication error handling
- [ ] All integrations log failures for monitoring
