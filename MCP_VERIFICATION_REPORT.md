## Verification Tests

### 1. Health Check Endpoints

```bash
# Testing Environment
curl https://sentiatest.financeflo.ai/api/health
‚úÖ Response: {"status":"ok","server":"railway-ultimate","version":"1.0.0"}

# Production Environment
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.up.railway.app/api/health
‚úÖ Response: {"status":"ok","server":"railway-ultimate","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### 2. MCP Integration Endpoints (Post-Deployment)

```bash
# MCP Health Check
curl https://[domain]/api/mcp/health
‚è≥ Pending: Requires MCP Server deployment

# MCP Status
curl https://[domain]/api/mcp/status
‚è≥ Pending: Requires MCP Server deployment

# WebSocket Stats
curl https://[domain]/api/mcp/websocket/stats
‚è≥ Pending: Requires MCP Server deployment
```

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard Access

## Required Actions

### 1. Deploy MCP Server (Critical)
```bash
# Navigate to MCP Server directory
cd mcp-server

# Deploy to Railway service
railway link --service 99691282-de66-45b2-98cf-317083dd11ba
railway up
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Run validation script
.\scripts\validate-environment.ps1 -Environment production

# Set missing variables in Railway
railway variables set MCP_SERVER_URL=https://web-production-99691282.up.railway.app
railway variables set MCP_SERVER_SERVICE_ID=99691282-de66-45b2-98cf-317083dd11ba
railway variables set MCP_JWT_SECRET=[generated-secret]
```

### 3. Configure API Keys
```bash
# Generate and configure API keys
.\scripts\configure-api-keys.ps1 -Environment production

# Add to Railway
railway variables set XERO_CLIENT_ID=[your-id]
railway variables set XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=[your-secret]
railway variables set SHOPIFY_API_KEY=[your-key]
railway variables set SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=[your-secret]
```

### 4. Enable Auto-Sync (Production Only)
```bash
# After deployment verification
curl -X POST https://sentia-manufacturing-production.up.railway.app/api/mcp/sync/enable
```
