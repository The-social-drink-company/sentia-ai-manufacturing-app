## Root Cause Analysis

Render services can be suspended for several reasons:

### Possible Causes:
1. **Billing/Payment Issue**:
   - Outstanding balance on Render account
   - Expired payment method
   - Exceeded free tier limits

2. **Resource Limits**:
   - Exceeded bandwidth allocation
   - Exceeded build minutes
   - Database storage limits reached

3. **Policy Violation**:
   - Terms of service violation
   - Suspicious activity detected
   - Resource abuse

4. **Manual Suspension**:
   - Account owner manually suspended services
   - Intentional pause for cost management

---

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Work:
- ✅ **Development COMPLETE**: PR #15 merged to development branch (commit 1bcd41b3)
- ❌ **Deployment Verification BLOCKED**: Cannot verify auto-deployment
- ❌ **Smoke Testing BLOCKED**: Cannot access UI to verify routing/navigation
- ❌ **End-to-End Testing BLOCKED**: Cannot test full import/export flows
- ❌ **QA Review BLOCKED**: Cannot perform UAT scenarios
- ❌ **User Acceptance BLOCKED**: Cannot demo to stakeholders

### Code Status:
- ✅ All code changes committed and pushed to development branch
- ✅ All components implemented and passing unit tests
- ✅ Code quality verified (0 errors, 15 warnings)
- ✅ Git workflow clean and up-to-date

**Conclusion**: The code is deployment-ready, but infrastructure is blocking verification.

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Actions (Account Owner):

1. **Access Render Dashboard**:
   - Login to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Navigate to account settings
   - Check for suspension notifications or alerts

2. **Verify Billing Status**:
   - Check "Billing & Usage" section
   - Verify payment method is valid and current
   - Review outstanding balances
   - Check for exceeded free tier limits

3. **Check Service Logs**:
   - Navigate to each service dashboard
   - Check for suspension reason messages
   - Review recent deployment logs for errors

4. **Contact Render Support** (if needed):
   - Email: support@render.com
   - Include service names and issue description
   - Request suspension reason and resolution timeline

### Post-Resolution Actions (Development Team):

1. **Verify Service Reactivation**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h.onrender.com/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
   ```

2. **Monitor Auto-Deployment**:
   - Check Render dashboard for deployment status
   - Verify development branch auto-deploys after reactivation
   - Monitor build logs for errors

3. **Smoke Testing**:
   - Login to development environment
   - Navigate to /app/admin/import
   - Navigate to /app/admin/export
   - Verify pages load without errors
   - Check sidebar navigation shows new links

4. **Continue BMAD Workflow**:
   - Resume deployment checklist: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST-BMAD-UI-001.md`
   - Perform UAT scenarios
   - Complete QA review
   - Get stakeholder approval

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Alternative Hosting (Temporary)
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify for immediate testing
- Update `.env` files with temporary URLs
- Continue development and testing
- **Downside**: Requires reconfiguration and may have different behavior

### Option 2: Local Development (Limited)
- Run application locally with `pnpm dev`
- Test UI components and routing
- **Downside**: Cannot test SSE with BullMQ queues (requires Redis)
- **Downside**: Cannot test actual file uploads/downloads

### Option 3: Wait for Resolution (Recommended)
- Continue with backend API implementation (BMAD-API-001)
- Write additional tests (BMAD-TEST-001)
- Improve documentation
- **Upside**: No wasted effort on temporary solutions
- **Upside**: Productive work while waiting for infrastructure

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Monitoring Setup:
1. **Uptime Monitoring**:
   - Configure UptimeRobot or similar service
   - Monitor all three environments (dev, test, production)
   - Alert on downtime within 5 minutes

2. **Cost Monitoring**:
   - Set up Render billing alerts
   - Monitor resource usage dashboard weekly
   - Set budget limits to prevent overages

3. **Health Check Automation**:
   - Add health check to CI/CD pipeline
   - Fail builds if health check returns suspension page
   - Alert team immediately on suspension

### Billing Best Practices:
1. **Payment Method Backup**:
   - Add secondary payment method
   - Enable automatic payment retry
   - Set up billing notifications

2. **Usage Review**:
   - Review Render usage monthly
   - Optimize resource allocation
   - Consider upgrading plan if frequently hitting limits

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use free tier efficiently
   - Scale down unused services
   - Consider consolidating environments

## Communication

### Stakeholder Notification:

**Subject**: Import/Export Epic Deployment Blocked by Infrastructure Issue

**Message**:
```
The Import/Export epic (BMAD-UI-001) is complete and code has been merged to the development branch. However, deployment verification is currently blocked due to Render service suspension.

**Current Status**:
✅ Development COMPLETE (PR #15 merged)
✅ Code Quality VERIFIED (0 errors)
⚠️ Deployment BLOCKED (Render suspension)

**Next Steps**:
1. Account owner to resolve Render service suspension
2. Development team to verify deployment once service is restored
3. Continue with QA review and UAT testing

**Estimated Resolution**: Pending account owner action (typically 1-2 business days)

**Impact**: No code changes blocked, only deployment verification and testing delayed.
```
