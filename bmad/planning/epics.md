## EPIC-002: Eliminate All Mock Data ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** (90% Complete)

**Status**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Duration**: 3.5 weeks estimated (~1 hour remaining)
**Stories**: 9/10 complete (90%)
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 3 (Verification & Documentation) - Final Story

- [x] Sprint retrospectives documented (✅ BMAD-MOCK-001, 002, 005, 006 retrospectives complete)

### Key Learnings (Sprint 1, 2, & 3 Verification)

1. **Existing Services Accelerate Development**: Xero, Shopify, Amazon, and Unleashed services all pre-existed, saved ~30 hours total
2. **Three-Tier Fallback Strategy Works**: real → estimates → setup instructions provides excellent UX
3. **Reusable Patterns Established**: Setup prompt template, dashboard API integration, documentation structure, SSE events
4. **Pre-Implementation Audits Critical**: BMAD-MOCK-006 audit revealed 90% completion, prevented 92% wasted effort
5. **Sprint Velocity Acceleration**: Story 1 (100%) → Story 2 (24%) → Story 5 (25%) → Story 6 (8%) → Story 8 (50%) = accelerating velocity
6. **Pattern Reuse Delivers**: Each integration story after BMAD-MOCK-001 takes 70-92% less time than estimated
7. **Service Discovery Critical**: Always audit existing code before estimating - prevents re-implementation
8. **Auto-Systems Work Ahead**: Linter/auto-commit systems often complete tasks (e.g., SSE events) before manual implementation
9. **Verification Stories Fast**: BMAD-MOCK-008 took 15 minutes (50% of 30-min estimate) - grep + manual review pattern efficient
10. **SSE Passive Broadcaster Pattern**: Correct architecture - SSE service only distributes events, never generates business data
