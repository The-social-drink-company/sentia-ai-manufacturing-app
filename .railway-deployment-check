Status Check:
✅ ClerkProvider duplicate fix applied and committed
✅ Code pushed to production branch 
✅ API health endpoints responding correctly
✅ Both URLs opening (manual browser test initiated)

Potential Issues:
- React app may still be building/deploying
- ClerkProvider fix may need few minutes to propagate
- Browser cache may need clearing

Next Actions:
1. Verify landing pages load in browser 
2. Test enterprise features (What-If Analysis, Working Capital)
3. Check for any remaining console errors
4. Confirm user can access dashboard functionality
