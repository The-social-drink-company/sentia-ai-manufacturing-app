## Workaround Plan (Local Testing)

While deployment issue is resolved, execute local testing for UI components.

### Can Test Locally ✅

**Test Suites** (partial):
- File Upload (UI interactions): FU-01 to FU-08 (8 tests)
- Column Mapping (UI only): CM-01, CM-02, CM-03, CM-04, CM-06, CM-07 (6 tests)
- Validation Results (UI only): VR-04, VR-05, VR-08 (3 tests)
- Accessibility (partial): Keyboard nav, screen reader, contrast (3 areas)

**Total Local Tests**: ~20 tests (24% of total)

### Cannot Test Locally ❌

**Blocked by Infrastructure**:
- BullMQ queue processing (16 tests)
- SSE real-time updates (8 tests)
- Backend API validation (10 tests)
- RBAC enforcement (8 tests)
- Database operations (12 tests)
- Integration scenarios (5 scenarios)
- Performance benchmarks (8 benchmarks)
- Security tests (10 tests)

**Total Blocked Tests**: ~63 tests (76% of total)

## Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Proceed with Local Testing
**Date**: 2025-10-18 03:15 BST
**Rationale**: While deployment is blocked, we can make progress on UI-level functional testing
**Impact**: Can execute ~20 tests locally, unblocks some QA progress
**Risk**: May find issues that can't be fully validated without backend

### Decision 2: Document Blocker for Retrospective
**Date**: 2025-10-18 03:15 BST
**Rationale**: BMAD retrospective should capture deployment issues as process improvement
**Impact**: Ensures learnings are captured for future sprints
**Action**: Created DEPLOY-BLOCK-001 document

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 1 hour)
1. ✅ Document blocker (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ Create test fixtures (COMPLETE)
3. ⏳ Start local dev server (`npm run dev`)
4. ⏳ Begin File Upload UI tests (FU-01 to FU-08)
5. ⏳ Begin Column Mapping UI tests (CM-01 to CM-07)

### Short-term (Next 4 hours)
**If deployment restored**:
- Resume full QA test plan
- Execute all 83 tests as designed
- Complete Phase 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

**If deployment still blocked**:
- Complete all local UI tests (~20 tests)
- Document which tests passed/failed
- Prepare for full testing when unblocked

### Medium-term (Next day)
**If deployment restored**:
- Execute remaining 63 tests
- Complete QA sign-off
- Update BMAD retrospective
- Proceed to Phase 4 (production deployment)

**If deployment still blocked**:
- Escalate blocker to stakeholders
- Consider Option 2 (deploy to test environment)
- Or Option 4 (defer QA, move to next epic)

---

## Success Criteria

**QA Phase Complete When**:
- [ ] All 83 test cases executed
- [ ] >95% pass rate achieved
- [ ] All critical bugs resolved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security tests passed
- [ ] Accessibility score > 95
- [ ] QA sign-off document created

**Current Status**: 0% complete (0/83 tests executed)

---

## Timeline

**Original Plan** (No Blocker):
- Day 1 AM: Preparation (COMPLETE ✅)
- Day 1 PM: Functional testing
- Day 2 AM: Integration testing
- Day 2 PM: Performance, security, accessibility
- Day 2 End: QA sign-off

**Revised Plan** (With Blocker):
- Day 1 AM: Preparation (COMPLETE ✅)
- Day 1 PM: Local UI testing (~20 tests)
- **BLOCKED**: Awaiting deployment restoration
- Day 2+: Resume full testing when unblocked

**Estimated Delay**: 0.5-2 days (depends on blocker resolution time)

---

**Status**: 🚨 **BLOCKED** by deployment issue (DEPLOY-BLOCK-001)
**Progress**: 10% (Preparation complete, testing blocked)
**Next Update**: When deployment restored or local testing begins
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18 03:15 BST
