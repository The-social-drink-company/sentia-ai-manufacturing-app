3. **Run database migrations**: Initialize schema in each environment

### Database Initialization:

```bash
# For each environment after deployment completes:

# Development
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/api/db/migrate

# Testing
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-testing.onrender.com/api/db/migrate

# Production (use with caution)
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/api/db/migrate
```
