# BMAD-UI-001 Import/Export UI - Deployment Status

**Epic**: BMAD-UI-001 - Import/Export Frontend UI Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Phase 2) ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Awaiting Deployment Configuration

---

## Executive Summary

The Import/Export UI epic (BMAD-UI-001) is **fully implemented and ready for deployment**, but requires a deployment configuration decision before it can be verified on the live environment.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ All code complete and merged to `development` branch (PR #15)
- ‚úÖ Code quality verified (0 errors, 15 warnings)
- ‚úÖ QA review complete (9.2/10 score)
- ‚úÖ Retrospective documented with lessons learned
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Render deployment configured for `main` branch (missing latest work)
- ‚ùå Import/Export UI not visible on live site (wrong branch deployed)

---

## Root Cause: Branch Mismatch

### What's Happening:
1. **Development Work**: PR #15 merged to `development` branch (commit `ba03fe46`)
2. **Render Deployment**: Configured to deploy from `main` branch (commit `1227ac36`)
3. **Result**: Live site shows old code without Import/Export UI

### Evidence:
From Render deployment logs (2025-10-18 01:58:38):
```
==> Checking out commit 8b8c846c33f99e1dabfde1b8b5e79e31300b848b in branch main
...
==> Your site is live üéâ
```

**Problem**: Commit `8b8c846c` is from `main` branch and predates the Import/Export work.

**Solution Needed**: Either merge `development` ‚Üí `main`, OR reconfigure Render to deploy from `development`.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Merge development ‚Üí main (Recommended)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Aligns with documented workflow in CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Maintains clean git history
- ‚úÖ Allows for staged rollout (dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí production)
- ‚úÖ No Render configuration changes needed

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires explicit merge decision
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Makes Import/Export live immediately (no rollback without revert)

**Commands**:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
# Render will auto-deploy within 2-3 minutes
```

---

### Option 2: Configure Render to Deploy from development

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Immediate deployment of Import/Export UI
- ‚úÖ No git operations required

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Contradicts CLAUDE.md documentation (says dev deploys to dev environment)
- ‚ùå Requires Render dashboard access
- ‚ùå May confuse future developers about branch strategy
- ‚ùå Breaks documented workflow (dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí production)

**Steps**:
1. Login to Render dashboard
2. Navigate to service settings
3. Change branch from `main` to `development`
4. Trigger manual deploy

---

## Recommended Action

**Use Option 1: Merge development ‚Üí main**

**Rationale**:
1. BMAD Phase 2 is complete and QA-approved
2. Code quality is verified (9.2/10 score)
3. All tests passing
4. Proper git workflow maintains long-term project health
5. Render configuration matches documented process

**Timeline**:
- Merge: 5 minutes
- Render auto-deploy: 3-5 minutes
- Smoke testing: 10 minutes
- **Total**: 20-30 minutes to live verification

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

Once deployed, verify the following:

### Smoke Test Checklist:
1. **Navigate to application**: https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-621h.onrender.com
2. **Login**: Use development credentials
3. **Check sidebar**: Verify "Import Wizard" and "Export Builder" links visible
4. **Navigate to Import**: `/app/admin/import` loads without errors
5. **Navigate to Export**: `/app/admin/export` loads without errors
6. **Check console**: No JavaScript errors
7. **Verify RBAC**: Links only visible to manager/admin/master_admin roles

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Pages load successfully
- ‚úÖ Navigation links present
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Role-based access working
- ‚úÖ UI matches design specifications

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

Following BMAD-METHOD workflow, after deployment:

1. **Smoke Testing** (10 minutes)
   - Verify routing and navigation working
   - Check role-based access control
   - Ensure no console errors

2. **End-to-End Testing** (30 minutes)
   - Test full import wizard flow (6 steps)
   - Test export builder flow
   - Verify SSE progress tracking
   - Test error scenarios

3. **QA Sign-Off** (1 hour)
   - Run UAT scenarios from deployment checklist
   - Accessibility audit (Lighthouse)
   - Performance testing (file upload, validation)
   - Cross-browser testing

4. **Stakeholder Demo** (30 minutes)
   - Demonstrate import wizard
   - Demonstrate export builder
   - Show real-time progress tracking
   - Get product owner approval

5. **Deploy to Test Environment**
   - Merge `development` ‚Üí `test` branch
   - Perform full UAT with stakeholders
   - Get sign-off before production

6. **Deploy to Production** (when UAT passes)
   - Merge `test` ‚Üí `production` branch
   - Final smoke testing
   - Monitor for 24 hours

## Decision Required

**Question for User/Stakeholders**:

Should we merge the `development` branch to `main` to deploy the Import/Export UI to the live environment?

**Context**:
- ‚úÖ Code is QA-approved and ready
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Will make Import/Export features live immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires smoke testing and UAT after deployment

**Default Recommendation**: YES - Merge and deploy (following BMAD workflow)
