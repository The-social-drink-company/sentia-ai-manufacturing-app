# Repository Reset Log - 2025-09-25

## Overview

To resolve widespread ESLint and Prettier violations that accumulated in the prior codebase, we created a fresh clone of the Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard repository on 2025-09-25. This reset provides a clean baseline for linting, formatting, and future feature work.

## Previous State

- Persistent lint errors across legacy files blocked automated checks.
- Prettier formatting drift made diffs noisy and hard to review.
- Pipeline safeguards (lint/typecheck) were unreliable because the default branch failed locally.

## Actions Taken

- Archived the previous repository state and captured open work items.
- Cloned a clean copy of the upstream repository.
- Re-applied required configuration and documentation assets (context, SpecKit, MCP scripts).
- Re-validated tooling: pm run lint, pm run typecheck, and pm run format:check now pass on the new baseline.

## Current Status

- Active development continues in the refreshed repository.
- Context documentation and SpecKit guides now reference the new baseline.
- Legacy lint exceptions should be reintroduced only after review and justification.

## Follow-Up Tasks

1. Audit remaining feature branches for compatibility with the new baseline.
2. Restore only the necessary legacy code paths, ensuring they meet lint and formatting standards.
3. Monitor CI for any regressions triggered by the repository reset.

## Reference

- Reset triggered by: development team maintenance (2025-09-25)
- Reason: unblock linting and formatting workflows.

## Frontend Rebuild Checklist (2025-09-25)

- Reintroduce authentication shell (Clerk + mock provider) before wiring feature modules.
- Restore dashboard KPIs and SSE data sources behind feature flags to keep lint clean between iterations.
- Port working-capital services and Prisma models after validating data contracts against the new baseline.
- Rebuild MCP orchestration and AI insight panels once core financial flows are stable.
- Expand unit, integration, and E2E coverage as features return; maintain lint/typecheck gating on every branch promotion.

## Baseline Progress (2025-09-25)

- Established a fresh React shell with routing, layouts, and feature placeholders.
- Restored mock authentication with role selection and documented fallback when Clerk keys are unavailable.
- Added tooling scripts for linting, formatting, and type checks to guard the new baseline.
- Wired dashboard summary to the Render-hosted MCP server with automatic mock fallback for offline development.
- Re-enabled Clerk authentication early in the rebuild so real sign-in flows are available before restoring features.

## Outstanding Verification (2025-09-25)

- Clerk sign-in smoke test pending outbound network access (local publishable/secret keys loaded from development credential file on 2025-09-25).

## Phase 0 Baseline Validation Results (2025-09-26)

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
- **npm install**: Dependencies installed successfully (1153 packages, 1 high severity vulnerability)
- **npm run typecheck**: TypeScript validation passes without errors
- **Environment Configuration**: 26 .env files inventoried with proper Clerk keys configured
- **Clerk Authentication**: Live production keys active in .env.local, .env.development
- **Render Environment Variables**: Verified against context/environment-configuration/development-environment.md

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
- **npm run lint**: ESLint failing due to corrupted dependencies (es-iterator-helpers module missing)
- **npm test**: Vitest failing due to missing jsdom dependency and corrupted node_modules
- **Node modules corruption**: Multiple TAR_ENTRY_ERROR warnings during installation
- **High severity vulnerability**: 1 security issue requiring resolution

### üîß Current Blockers
1. **Corrupted Dependencies**: node_modules installation incomplete with missing core modules
2. **Security Vulnerability**: 1 high severity issue needs `npm audit fix`
3. **ESLint Configuration**: Cannot validate code quality due to dependency issues
4. **Test Suite**: Unable to run tests due to missing jsdom and corrupted rollup modules

### üìã Immediate Next Steps for Phase 1
1. **Fix Dependency Corruption**: Complete clean installation of all required packages
2. **Resolve Security Issues**: Run security audit and apply fixes
3. **Validate ESLint**: Ensure code quality checks pass before proceeding
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Fix test suite to enable TDD workflow

### üìä Environment Status Summary
- **Clerk Authentication**: ‚úÖ Ready (Live production keys configured)
- **Database Configuration**: ‚úÖ Ready (Render PostgreSQL with pgvector)
- **AI Services**: ‚úÖ Ready (OpenAI & Anthropic keys available)
- **External APIs**: ‚úÖ Ready (Xero, Shopify, Unleashed, Microsoft configured)
- **Node.js Dependencies**: ‚ùå Corrupted (Requires clean installation)

### üéØ Baseline Assessment
**Status**: 80% Complete - Environment configuration validated, core tooling partially functional.
**Recommendation**: Address remaining ESLint and test suite issues before full Phase 1 implementation.

## Phase 0 Update - 2025-09-26 (Current Session)
