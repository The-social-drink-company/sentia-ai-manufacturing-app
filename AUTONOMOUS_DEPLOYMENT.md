# 🤖 24/7 Autonomous Testing & Deployment System

This document describes the comprehensive autonomous testing and deployment system that runs 24/7 and automatically deploys improvements to Railway every 10 minutes.

## 🚀 System Overview

The autonomous system consists of:

1. **Service Manager** (`service-manager.js`) - 24/7 service reliability
2. **Testing Scheduler** (`autonomous-scheduler.js`) - 10-minute test cycles
3. **Self-Healing Engine** - Automatic issue detection and fixes
4. **Multi-Branch Deployment** - development → test → production pipeline
5. **GitHub Integration** - Automated commits, pushes, and deployments

## 📋 Features

### ✅ Continuous Testing

- **Self-Healing**: Automatic detection and fixing of common issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: API response times, UI functionality
- **Multi-Environment**: Tests against all Railway environments

### ✅ Automated Deployment
- **Development Branch**: Updated every 10 minutes with fixes
- **Test Branch**: Promoted from development when stable
- **Production Branch**: Promoted from test when validated
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on critical failures

### ✅ Enterprise Reliability
- **24/7 Operation**: Service manager ensures continuous uptime
- **Health Monitoring**: 60-second health checks
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatic recovery from failures

### Health Monitoring
The system monitors:
- Test execution success rates
- API endpoint response times
- UI component availability
- Railway deployment success
- Service uptime and restarts

## 🔧 Configuration

### Service Manager Settings
```javascript
config: {
  healthCheckIntervalMs: 60000,      // 1 minute health checks
  maxInactivityMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,   // 15 minutes max inactivity
  restartCooldownMs: 30000,          // 30 seconds between restarts
  enableAutoRestart: true,
  enableHealthMonitoring: true
}
```

### Scheduler Settings
- **Test Frequency**: Every 10 minutes (configurable)
- **Backoff Strategy**: Exponential (5, 10, 20 minutes)
- **Max Failures**: 3 consecutive failures trigger backoff
- **Deployment Threshold**: Only deploy when tests are passing

## 🤖 Self-Healing Capabilities

### Automatic Fixes Applied
1. **API Endpoint Failures**
   - Restart API server
   - Clear cache and reinitialize services
   - Update endpoint configurations

2. **UI Test Failures**
   - Browser cache clearing
   - Component re-initialization
   - Frontend service restart

3. **Database Connectivity**
   - Connection pool refresh
   - Retry failed queries
   - Fallback to backup configurations

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Git repository cleanup
   - Branch synchronization
   - Conflict resolution

## 🔒 Security Features

### Automated Git Operations
- **Signed Commits**: All commits include Claude Code attribution
- **Branch Protection**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- **Clean History**: Structured commit messages with deployment tracking

### Environment Isolation
- **Development**: Safe testing environment
- **Test**: User acceptance testing
- **Production**: Live environment (only promoted after validation)
