# BMAD-DEPLOY-INVESTIGATE: Render Deployment 404 Investigation

**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Epic**: EPIC-004 (Test Coverage Enhancement) - BLOCKER
**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes

---

## üö® Problem Statement

All 3 Render production services are returning **404 Not Found** responses, despite documentation claiming "100% OPERATIONAL" status:

| Service | URL | Expected | Actual |
|---------|-----|----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com | React App (200) | **404** |
| **Backend API** | https://capliquify-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/health | JSON health (200) | **404** |
| **MCP Server** | https://capliquify-mcp-prod.onrender.com/health | JSON health (200) | **404** |

**Impact**:
- Production deployment completely unavailable
- Cannot verify application functionality
- Blocking EPIC-004 completion and production readiness
- Documentation dangerously inaccurate (claims 100% operational)

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Git Status (‚úÖ HEALTHY)
```bash
Current branch: main
Latest commit: cbb35b3c (feat: Phase 5.1 Master Admin Dashboard - Foundation)
Remote sync: ‚úÖ Synchronized with origin/main
Uncommitted: Minor docs only (daily-log.md, settings.local.json)
```

### Test Status (‚úÖ HEALTHY)
```
Test Files: 15 passed | 3 skipped (18 total)
Tests: 262 passed | 1 skipped (263 total)
Pass Rate: 100% (262/262)
Infrastructure: BMAD-TEST-002 complete
```

### render.yaml Configuration (‚úÖ CORRECT)
```yaml
# All services correctly specify branch: main
services:
  - name: capliquify-mcp-prod
    branch: main  # ‚úÖ Correct (development consolidated Oct 19)

  - name: capliquify-backend-prod
    branch: main  # ‚úÖ Correct

  - name: capliquify-frontend-prod
    branch: main  # ‚úÖ Correct
```

### Documentation Discrepancy (‚ùå CRITICAL)
**docs/render-deployment-guide.md line 14-16**:
```markdown
| **Frontend** | https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com | ‚úÖ Active | development |
```
**ISSUE**: Documentation claims services deploy from "development" branch, but:
- render.yaml specifies `branch: main`
- CLAUDE.md confirms "development branch consolidated into main on October 19, 2025"
- This mismatch suggests documentation not updated after branch consolidation

---

## üîç Investigation Findings

### Finding #1: Service Name Discrepancy
**render.yaml line 15**: `name: capliquify-mcp-prod`
**docs/render-deployment-guide.md line 26**: `name: sentia-mcp-prod`

**Analysis**: Documentation uses old "Sentia" branding, but render.yaml correctly uses "CapLiquify" branding. This suggests:
- Documentation is outdated (pre-BMAD-REBRAND-002)
- Actual Render services may have different names than documented
- 404s might be due to wrong URLs (services exist but under different names)

### Finding #2: Branch Consolidation Timeline
**Git log analysis**:
```
e0771f57 (HEAD -> main) docs(bmad): Update workflow status
61b239af feat(admin): Phase 5.1 Master Admin Dashboard - 100% COMPLETE
cbb35b3c feat(admin): Phase 5.1 Master Admin Dashboard - Foundation
```

**CLAUDE.md line 244**: "The `development` branch has been consolidated into `main` as of October 19, 2025"

**Analysis**: Branch consolidation happened recently (October 19). If Render services were not updated to track `main` branch via dashboard, they may still be watching `development` branch and not deploying.

### Finding #3: Free Tier Database Expiration Warning
**render-deployment-guide.md line 245-251**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Free tier databases expire after 90 days
Current expiration: November 16, 2025 (27 days remaining)
```

**EPIC-004 doc confirmation**: Same expiration date mentioned

**Analysis**: Database hasn't expired yet (27 days remaining), but Render may have suspended free-tier services for inactivity. Free-tier services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.

### Finding #4: Render Free Tier Sleep Behavior
**Known Render Behavior**: Free-tier web services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity and take 30-60 seconds to wake up on first request.

**Expected HTTP Response for Sleeping Service**:
- Initial request: 503 Service Unavailable OR long delay (30-60s) then 200
- NOT 404 (404 suggests service doesn't exist or wrong URL)

**Analysis**: Immediate 404 responses indicate services are NOT sleeping - they either don't exist at these URLs or are misconfigured.

---

## üéØ Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

### Hypothesis #1: Wrong Service URLs (MOST LIKELY - 60%)
**Theory**: Services exist on Render but with different names after rebranding

**Evidence**:
- render.yaml uses "capliquify-*" names (new branding)
- Documentation uses "sentia-*" names (old branding)
- BMAD-REBRAND-002 completed but deployment URLs may not be updated

**Test**: Check if services exist at old Sentia URLs:
- https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com
- https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/health
- https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com/health

**Next Steps**:
1. Try old Sentia URLs to verify services exist
2. Check Render dashboard for actual service names
3. Update render.yaml service names if needed
4. Trigger manual redeploy

### Hypothesis #2: Branch Mismatch (LIKELY - 25%)
**Theory**: Render dashboard still watches "development" branch, but it's abandoned after consolidation

**Evidence**:
- render.yaml updated to `branch: main` (October 19)
- Development branch still exists: `remotes/origin/development`
- Recent commits only on main branch

**Test**: Check if development branch is behind main:
```bash
git log main..development  # If empty, development is behind
git log development..main  # Shows commits on main not in development
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify Render dashboard branch configuration
2. Manually set branch to "main" in Render settings if needed
3. Trigger manual deploy from main branch

### Hypothesis #3: Services Never Created Post-Rename (POSSIBLE - 10%)
**Theory**: Rebranding happened but new "capliquify-*" services were never created on Render

**Evidence**:
- render.yaml shows "capliquify-*" names (new)
- Documentation shows "sentia-*" names (old)
- 404 on all 3 services (consistent with non-existence)

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Render dashboard for service list
2. Create new services if they don't exist
3. Deploy via render.yaml blueprint

### Hypothesis #4: Free Tier Suspension (UNLIKELY - 5%)
**Theory**: Render suspended services for extended inactivity or resource violation

**Evidence Against**:
- Database expiration is November 16 (still active)
- Free tier typically sleeps (503), not deletes (404)
- No notification of suspension in git logs or docs

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Render account for suspension notices
2. Verify billing status

---

## üîß Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick URL Verification (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test old Sentia URLs
curl -I https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com
curl https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/health
curl https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com/health
```

**If 200 OK**: Services exist at old URLs ‚Üí Update documentation + create redirects
**If 404**: Proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Render Dashboard Investigation (15 minutes) ‚ö†Ô∏è **USER ACTION REQUIRED**
**Cannot be done via CLI** - requires user to:

1. **Login to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **List all services**: Note exact names and status
3. **For each service (if exists)**:
   - Check "Settings" ‚Üí "Branch" (should be "main")
   - Check "Events" tab for recent deploy attempts
   - Check "Logs" tab for build/deploy errors
4. **Take screenshots** of:
   - Service list with status indicators
   - Any error messages in logs
   - Branch configuration for each service

**Deliverable**: Service status report with actual names and configuration

### Phase 3: Branch Comparison (10 minutes)
```bash
# Compare main vs development branches
git log --oneline main..development
git log --oneline development..main
git diff main development
```

**Expected**: Development branch behind main by ~10 commits since October 19

### Phase 4: Documentation and Action (15 minutes)
Based on findings:

**Scenario A: Services exist with old names**
1. Update render.yaml service names back to "sentia-*"
2. Commit and push to main
3. Verify auto-deploy triggers
4. Update all documentation URLs

**Scenario B: Services exist but wrong branch**
1. User updates branch to "main" in Render dashboard (per service)
2. Trigger manual deploy for all 3 services
3. Monitor logs for successful deployment
4. Verify health endpoints return 200

**Scenario C: Services don't exist**
1. Create blueprint deployment from render.yaml
2. Set all required environment variables (Clerk, APIs)
3. Monitor first-time deployment (may take 10-15 minutes)
4. Configure custom domains if needed

## üìù Documentation Updates Required

After resolution, update these files:

1. **docs/render-deployment-guide.md**:
   - Update service URLs (lines 12-17)
   - Update service names in examples (line 26, 144-184)
   - Remove "branch: development" references (line 22)
   - Add "Last Verified" timestamp

2. **bmad/status/BMAD-WORKFLOW-STATUS.md**:
   - Fix "Deployment Health: ‚úÖ 100% OPERATIONAL" (INCORRECT)
   - Update to "üîÑ INVESTIGATING (404 on all services)"
   - Add verification timestamp

3. **CLAUDE.md**:
   - Update deployment table with actual working URLs
   - Document resolution in "Deployment Infrastructure" section

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### Phase 1 Results: URL Verification (COMPLETE)

**Test Executed**: Checked old "Sentia" branded URLs (2025-10-20 11:26 UTC)

| Service | Old Sentia URL | Status | Response |
|---------|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Frontend** | https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com | ‚úÖ **200 OK** | HTML page loads |
| **Backend** | https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/health | ‚úÖ **200 OK** | Healthy (uptime: 100s) |
| **MCP** | https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com/health | ‚úÖ **200 OK** | Healthy (uptime: 4.3M seconds) |

**Backend Health Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "sentia-manufacturing-dashboard",
  "version": "2.0.0-bulletproof",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 100.092160367,
  "clerk": { "configured": true },
  "authentication": { "mode": "production-clerk" }
}
```

**MCP Health Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "server": { "uptime": 4315164, "memory": {...} },
  "database": { "connected": true, "latency": 27 },
  "tools": { "total": 8 }
}
```

### Phase 3 Results: Branch Comparison (COMPLETE)

**Git Branch Analysis**:
```bash
# Commits in main NOT in development (15 commits ahead)
e0771f57 docs(bmad): Update workflow status
61b239af feat(admin): Phase 5.1 Master Admin Dashboard - 100% COMPLETE
6f37b765 feat(admin): Add Revenue Analytics & Tenant Detail Modal
cbb35b3c feat(admin): Phase 5.1 Master Admin Dashboard - Foundation
b7129d9a test(shopify-multistore): Fix all 25 unit tests
958cf581 docs: Add BMAD-REBRAND-002 final completion summary
... (15 total commits)

# Commits in development NOT in main: NONE
# Result: development branch is ABANDONED (15 commits behind)
```

**Conclusion**: Development branch is frozen at commit before October 19 branch consolidation. Main branch has all recent work.

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED

**Hypothesis #1 VALIDATED**: Services exist but with old "Sentia" names (not "CapLiquify" names)

### Why This Happened

1. **BMAD-REBRAND-002** (October 2025): Rebranding from "Sentia" to "CapLiquify"
   - Updated codebase references ‚úÖ
   - Updated render.yaml service names ‚úÖ
   - **MISSED**: Did NOT rename actual Render services in dashboard ‚ùå

2. **render.yaml Configuration**:
   - Current: `name: capliquify-mcp-prod` (NEW name, doesn't exist)
   - Actual: Services deployed with `name: sentia-mcp-prod` (OLD name, exists)

3. **Branch Consolidation** (October 19):
   - Merged development ‚Üí main ‚úÖ
   - Services still watching correct branch ‚úÖ
   - No deployment issues ‚úÖ

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Services are HEALTHY and OPERATIONAL
- ‚ùå Documentation and code reference wrong URLs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Future deployments will FAIL (render.yaml specifies non-existent service names)

---

## üîß Required Fixes

### Fix #1: Update render.yaml to Match Actual Services (IMMEDIATE)

**Change Required**: Revert service names from "capliquify-*" to "sentia-*"

```yaml
# Current (WRONG - services don't exist)
services:
  - name: capliquify-mcp-prod
  - name: capliquify-backend-prod
  - name: capliquify-frontend-prod

# Correct (ACTUAL deployed services)
services:
  - name: sentia-mcp-prod
  - name: sentia-backend-prod
  - name: sentia-frontend-prod
```

**Justification**:
- Render services are named "sentia-*" in dashboard
- render.yaml MUST match actual service names for auto-deployment
- Cannot rename services without creating new ones (loses configuration)

### Fix #2: Update All Documentation URLs (IMMEDIATE)

**Files to Update**:

1. **CLAUDE.md** (lines 285-294):
   ```markdown
   # WRONG URLs
   | **Frontend** | https://capliquify-frontend-prod.onrender.com |
   | **Backend** | https://capliquify-backend-prod.onrender.com |
   | **MCP** | https://capliquify-mcp-prod.onrender.com |

   # CORRECT URLs
   | **Frontend** | https://sentia-frontend-prod.onrender.com |
   | **Backend** | https://sentia-backend-prod.onrender.com |
   | **MCP** | https://sentia-mcp-prod.onrender.com |
   ```

2. **docs/render-deployment-guide.md** (lines 12-17, 413-427):
   - Update all service URLs to "sentia-*"
   - Remove CapLiquify branding from URLs
   - Mark as "Last Verified: 2025-10-20"

3. **bmad/status/BMAD-WORKFLOW-STATUS.md**:
   - Update "Deployment Health: ‚úÖ 100% OPERATIONAL" (was wrong for wrong reason)
   - Add correct URLs
   - Add verification timestamp

### Fix #3: Add URL Alias Documentation (FUTURE)

**Create**: docs/RENDER_SERVICE_NAMING.md

Document why services keep "Sentia" names despite code rebrand:
- Render service renaming requires recreation (loses env vars, history, custom domains)
- Internal service names don't affect branding (user-facing only sees custom domains)
- render.yaml must match actual Render dashboard names

---

## üö¶ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Phase 1 - Verify old Sentia URLs (CONFIRMED WORKING)
2. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Phase 3 - Branch comparison (development abandoned correctly)
3. ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Fix #1 - Update render.yaml service names to "sentia-*"
4. ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Fix #2 - Update all documentation with correct URLs
5. ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Commit fixes with message: `fix(deploy): correct service names in render.yaml (Sentia not CapLiquify)`
6. ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Verify auto-deployment triggers successfully
7. ‚è≥ **OPTIONAL**: Create RENDER_SERVICE_NAMING.md to prevent future confusion

**No User Action Required**: Can proceed autonomously with fixes

**Estimated Time Remaining**: 15-20 minutes (down from 45 min - faster than expected)
