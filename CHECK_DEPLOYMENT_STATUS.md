## üöÄ QUICK SETUP STEPS

### For Development Service (PRIORITY 1)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Open Development Service**
   - Click on `sentia-manufacturing-development`

3. **Navigate to Environment Tab**
   - Click "Environment" in the service menu

4. **Add Each Variable**
   - Click "Add Environment Variable"
   - Paste the name and value (no quotes)
   - Repeat for all 3 variables

5. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Service will auto-redeploy (5-10 minutes)

### For Production Service (PRIORITY 2)

If service exists:

- Follow same steps as development

If service doesn't exist (502 error suggests this):

1. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select `production` branch
4. Render will create service from render.yaml
5. Variables will be added automatically

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMMANDS

After adding variables and deployment completes:

```bash
# Quick health check
curl -I https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/health

# Check if production Clerk key is loaded
curl -s https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com | grep "pk_live_"

# If successful, you'll see:
# pk_live_REDACTED
```

---

## üí° CURRENT ISSUES

1. **Development Service**: Has TEST keys (`pk_test_`) instead of PRODUCTION keys (`pk_live_`)
2. **Production Service**: Returns 502 (service may not be created yet)
3. **Local Environment**: No environment variables set (normal for cloud deployment)

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After configuration:

- ‚úÖ Both services respond with 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Production Clerk keys detected (`pk_live_`)
- ‚úÖ Users can sign up/sign in
- ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible after authentication

---

## üìå ADDITIONAL NOTES

- The development service is LIVE but using wrong keys
- Production service needs to be created or is still deploying
- Adding these 3 variables is the minimum requirement
- Full list has 9 variables (see RENDER_ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

---

**Next Step**: Add the 3 critical variables to development service NOW to enable authentication.
