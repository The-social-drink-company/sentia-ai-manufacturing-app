**Feature Branch**: `001-sentia-manufacturing-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Production
**Input**: Enterprise manufacturing dashboard with working capital intelligence, what-if analysis, and AI-powered insights

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse enterprise requirements
   → Manufacturing company needs real-time visibility
2. Extract key concepts
   → Actors: Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer
   → Actions: Monitor KPIs, Analyze scenarios, Optimize capital
   → Data: Financial metrics, Production data, Inventory levels
   → Constraints: Enterprise security, Real-time updates
3. Define user workflows
   → Dashboard navigation, Data import, Report generation
4. Generate functional requirements
   → Each requirement testable via UI/API
5. Identify key entities
   → WorkingCapital, WhatIfScenario, DemandForecast
6. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements verified against implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec implemented and deployed)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a manufacturing operations manager, I need a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time visibility into working capital, production metrics, and financial scenarios, so I can make data-driven decisions to optimize cash flow and operational efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user is authenticated, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see real-time KPIs for current ratio, quick ratio, cash unlock potential, and annual improvement
2. **Given** manager role, **When** accessing working capital page, **Then** they can view and analyze AR/AP aging, inventory turnover, and cash conversion cycles
3. **Given** admin role, **When** navigating to what-if analysis, **Then** they can adjust sliders for scenario modeling and see impact on financial metrics
4. **Given** any user role, **When** data changes in backend, **Then** dashboard updates in real-time via SSE without page refresh

### Edge Cases
- System gracefully handles database disconnection with fallback UI
- Dashboard remains responsive with 1000+ concurrent users
- Export functionality works with large datasets (>10MB)
- Mobile responsive design adapts to all screen sizes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide role-based access control with Admin, Manager, Operator, and Viewer roles
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real-time KPI widgets for financial metrics
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to navigate between Dashboard, Working Capital, What-If Analysis, and other modules
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with external APIs (Xero, Shopify, Amazon SP-API, Unleashed)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support data import from spreadsheets and APIs
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide export functionality for reports in JSON/CSV formats
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- **FR-008**: System MUST include AI-powered analytics and forecasting
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain audit trail for all data modifications
- **FR-010**: System MUST support three deployment environments (development, test, production)

### Key Entities
- **WorkingCapital**: Represents financial metrics including current assets, liabilities, AR/AP aging
- **WhatIfScenario**: Scenario models with adjustable parameters and impact calculations
- **DemandForecast**: Predictive analytics for inventory and production planning
- **User**: Authentication entity with roles and permissions via Clerk
- **Dashboard**: Configurable widget layout with persistence

## Implementation Lessons Learned

### Critical Success Factors
- **Navigation System**: Enterprise sidebar with keyboard shortcuts (G+O, G+F, G+I)
- **Button Functionality**: All UI controls must have working implementations
- **Git Workflow**: Strict development → test → production progression
- **AI Integration**: MCP server with multi-LLM orchestration

### Known Issues Resolved
- **Package Manager Migration**: Fully migrated from npm to pnpm
- **Heroicon v2 Compatibility**: All icons updated to ArrowTrendingUpIcon/ArrowTrendingDownIcon
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced console.log with enterprise logging system
- **Render Environment Variables**: Proper loading via render.yaml configuration
- **Port Conflicts**: Resolved EADDRINUSE errors with process management
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Addressed vulnerabilities with pnpm audit
- **Build Performance**: Optimized to 9-11 seconds with code splitting

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS with memoization
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express with structured logging
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for AI embeddings
- **Authentication**: Clerk with production domain configuration
- **Deployment**: Render with auto-deploy for all branches
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with frozen lockfile for CI/CD
