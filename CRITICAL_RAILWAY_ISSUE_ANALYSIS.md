# CRITICAL RAILWAY MCP SERVER DEPLOYMENT ANALYSIS

## ISSUE STATUS: UNRESOLVED ‚ùå

After comprehensive configuration fixes, Railway is STILL serving the wrong application.

## TEST RESULTS
```bash
# Health endpoint returns "OK" (2 bytes) instead of JSON health status
curl https://sentia-mcp-server.railway.app/health
# Response: "OK" (should be JSON with server status)

# Root endpoint returns Railway ASCII art instead of MCP server info  
curl https://sentia-mcp-server.railway.app/
# Response: Railway API homepage (should be MCP server details)
```

## ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED
Railway is NOT running the MCP server code at all. It's serving a default Railway API application.

## CONFIGURATION FILES CREATED ‚úÖ
- `mcp-server/nixpacks.toml` - Proper startup configuration
- `mcp-server/railway.json` - Railway service configuration  
- `mcp-server/package.json` - Correct npm start script
- `mcp-server/Procfile` - Web process definition
- Environment variables documentation
- Comprehensive deployment instructions

## CRITICAL RAILWAY DASHBOARD ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. SERVICE ROOT DIRECTORY (CRITICAL)
**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí [MCP Service] ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deploy**
- **Root Directory**: Must be set to `/mcp-server`
- **Current**: Likely set to `/` (root directory)
- **Impact**: Railway is using root nixpacks.toml instead of mcp-server config

### 2. BUILD CONFIGURATION
**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí [MCP Service] ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deploy**
- **Build Command**: `npm ci --production=false`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Health Check**: `/health`

### 3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED
```
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=info
JWT_SECRET=sentia-mcp-secret-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-[ACTUAL-KEY]
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[ACTUAL-KEY]
```

### 4. FORCE REDEPLOY
After configuration changes:
- **Deployments Tab ‚Üí Deploy Latest**
- Monitor build logs for MCP server startup messages

## EXPECTED SUCCESS INDICATORS

### Successful Deployment Should Show:
```bash
# Health endpoint (300+ bytes JSON)
curl https://sentia-mcp-server.railway.app/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","services":{...}}

# Root endpoint (MCP server info)  
curl https://sentia-mcp-server.railway.app/
# Expected: {"name":"Sentia MCP Server","version":"2.0.0-enterprise-simple"}
```

### Build Logs Should Contain:
```
üß† Initializing AI Central Nervous System...
‚úÖ MCP Server: Enterprise server initialized
üöÄ Server running on port $PORT
```

## CURRENT STATUS
- ‚úÖ Local MCP server: FULLY FUNCTIONAL (all features working)
- ‚ùå Railway deployment: SERVING WRONG APPLICATION  
- ‚úÖ Configuration files: COMPLETE AND COMMITTED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Railway dashboard: REQUIRES MANUAL CONFIGURATION

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Access Railway Dashboard**
2. **Set root directory to `/mcp-server`** 
3. **Add environment variables**
4. **Force redeploy service**
5. **Verify endpoints return proper JSON responses**

The MCP server code is production-ready. The issue is purely Railway service configuration.
