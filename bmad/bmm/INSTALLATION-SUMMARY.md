## TestArch Automate Workflow

### Purpose

Automated testing and architecture validation workflow for ensuring code quality, test coverage, and architectural compliance in the Sentia Manufacturing AI Dashboard project.

### Key Features

#### Test Automation Modes

1. **Quick Mode** (~2 min) - Fast unit tests only
2. **Standard Mode** (~5 min) - Unit + integration tests
3. **Full Mode** (~15 min) - All tests + architecture validation
4. **CI/CD Mode** (~20 min) - Complete suite with coverage reports

#### Architecture Validation

- ✅ Mock data elimination verification
- ✅ API error handling compliance
- ✅ TypeScript/JSDoc type safety checks
- ✅ External integration fallback validation

#### Test Coverage Analysis

- ✅ Line coverage tracking
- ✅ Branch coverage analysis
- ✅ Function coverage reporting
- ✅ Critical path identification

#### BMAD Integration

- ✅ Auto-updates BMAD_UPDATE_QUEUE.md with discovered gaps
- ✅ Generates BMAD stories for critical issues
- ✅ Updates BMAD-METHOD-V6A-IMPLEMENTATION.md metrics
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting in {test_output_folder}

### Test Frameworks Configured

- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest
- **E2E**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Vitest coverage tools

### Architecture Rules Enforced

1. No mock data in production code
2. All API services must have error handling
3. All components must use TypeScript/JSDoc
4. External integrations must have fallback handling

## How to Use

### Invoke the Workflow

```bash
# Using BMAD workflow engine
bmad workflow testarch-automate

# Or direct invocation
workflow testarch/automate
```

### Workflow Steps

The workflow executes 8 comprehensive steps:

1. **Load Configuration** - Determine automation mode
2. **Analyze Codebase** - Scan project structure
3. **Run Tests** - Execute test suites based on mode
4. **Validate Architecture** - Check compliance rules
5. **Generate Test Report** - Compile comprehensive results
6. **Generate Coverage Report** - Detailed coverage analysis (CI/CD mode)
7. **Update BMAD Docs** - Sync findings to BMAD documentation
8. **Provide Summary** - Display results and next steps

### Expected Outputs

Reports saved to `{project-root}/test-results/`:

- `test-report-{date}.md` - Comprehensive test execution report
- `architecture-validation-{date}.md` - Architecture compliance report
- `coverage-report-{date}.md` - Coverage analysis (CI/CD mode only)

## Integration with BMAD-METHOD v6a

### Phase 4: Implementation Support

The testarch/automate workflow supports BMAD Phase 4 (Implementation) by:

1. **Quality Gates** - Ensures code meets quality standards before story completion
2. **Automated Validation** - Reduces manual QA effort
3. **Architecture Compliance** - Enforces BMAD architectural principles
4. **Continuous Feedback** - Immediate feedback loop for developers

### Story Workflow Integration

```
bmad dev dev-story → Code Implementation → testarch-automate → bmad qa review-story
                                             ↓
                                    Validates quality gates
                                    Generates issue stories
                                    Updates BMAD metrics
```

### Retrospective Support

- Provides quantitative data for retrospectives
- Tracks quality trends over time
- Identifies recurring patterns for process improvement

## Quality Metrics Tracked

### Test Metrics

- Total tests executed
- Pass/fail/skip counts
- Test execution time
- Test stability (flakiness detection)

### Coverage Metrics

- Overall coverage percentage
- Critical path coverage
- Uncovered code identification
- Coverage trends over time

### Architecture Metrics

- Mock data violation count
- API error handling compliance
- Type safety compliance
- Integration fallback coverage

### BMAD Integration Metrics

- Stories generated from issues
- Documentation update frequency
- Quality gate pass rate
- Deployment readiness score

## Configuration Options

### Customization Points

Edit `bmad/bmm/workflows/testarch/automate/workflow.yaml` to customize:

- Test framework commands
- Architecture rules
- Output locations
- Automation modes
- Quality thresholds

### Environment-Specific Settings

Edit `bmad/bmm/config.yaml` to configure:

- `user_name` - Developer name for reports
- `communication_language` - Workflow language
- `output_folder` - Documentation output location
- `test_output_folder` - Test report location

## Next Steps

### Immediate Usage

1. Run the workflow: `bmad workflow testarch-automate`
2. Select automation mode based on your needs
3. Review generated reports in `test-results/`
4. Address any critical issues identified

### Integration into CI/CD

1. Add to GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipeline
2. Use `ci_cd` mode for complete validation
3. Set quality gates based on pass rates and coverage
4. Block deployments on critical failures

### Continuous Improvement

1. Review architecture validation results regularly
2. Update architecture rules as standards evolve
3. Refine quality thresholds based on team capacity
4. Expand test coverage based on gap analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Workflow can't find test files
**Solution**: Ensure vitest.config.js is properly configured

**Issue**: Coverage reports not generating
**Solution**: Run in `ci_cd` mode and verify vitest coverage is installed

**Issue**: Architecture validation too strict
**Solution**: Adjust rules in workflow.yaml based on project maturity

### Getting Help

- Read workflow instructions: `bmad/bmm/workflows/testarch/automate/instructions.md`
- Check validation checklist: `bmad/bmm/workflows/testarch/automate/checklist.md`
- Review BMAD documentation: `bmad/docs/`
- Join BMAD Discord: https://discord.gg/gk8jAdXWmj

## Maintenance

### Version Updates

When updating BMAD-METHOD to newer versions:

1. Check for workflow.yaml schema changes
2. Update test framework commands if needed
3. Re-validate architecture rules against new standards
4. Update manifest files if module structure changes

### Adding New Rules

To add architecture validation rules:

1. Edit `workflow.yaml` → `architecture_rules` section
2. Add validation logic in `instructions.md` step 4
3. Update `checklist.md` with new validation criteria
4. Document new rules in module README.md

## Success Criteria

The BMM module installation is considered successful when:

- ✅ Module appears in `bmad/_cfg/manifest.yaml`
- ✅ Workflow registered in `bmad/_cfg/workflow-manifest.csv`
- ✅ Workflow executes without errors
- ✅ Test reports generate successfully
- ✅ BMAD documentation updates automatically
- ✅ Quality gates enforced consistently

## Conclusion

The BMM (BMAD Method Module) with testarch/automate workflow provides comprehensive automated testing and architecture validation for the Sentia Manufacturing AI Dashboard project. It integrates seamlessly with BMAD-METHOD v6a workflows and ensures code quality, test coverage, and architectural compliance throughout the development lifecycle.
