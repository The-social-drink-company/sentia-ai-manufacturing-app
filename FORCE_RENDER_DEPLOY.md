# 🔥 FORCE RENDER TO USE CORRECT CODE

## The Problem
You're seeing an OLD cached "Railway Deployment Working!" page that doesn't exist in current code.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS IN RENDER DASHBOARD:

### Step 1: Clear Everything
1. Go to your service `sentia-manufacturing-development`
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Build & Deploy** section
4. Click **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. Wait for it to rebuild completely

### Step 2: Verify Correct Settings
While it's rebuilding, check these settings:

#### In Settings Tab:
- **Build Command**:
  ```
  npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy || npx prisma db push
  ```
- **Start Command**:
  ```
  node server.js
  ```
  ⚠️ NOT `node app.js` or `node index.js` or anything else!

#### In Environment Tab:
- **DATABASE_URL**: Must be set to your Render PostgreSQL Internal URL
- **PORT**: Should be 3000 (or not set, it will default to 3000)
- **NODE_ENV**: development

### Step 3: Manual Override (if needed)
If the start command shows something else:
1. In **Settings** tab
2. Find **Start Command** field
3. Click **Edit**
4. Change to: `node server.js`
5. Click **Save Changes**

### Step 4: Force Redeploy
1. Go to **Events** tab
2. Click **"Trigger Deploy"**
3. Select **"Clear build cache"** option
4. Click **Deploy**

## What Should Happen:

### In the Build Logs:
```
Building from GitHub commit...
Running build command: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build...
✓ built in XXs
✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

### In the Deploy Logs:
```
==> Running 'node server.js'
[ROOT PRIORITY] Handling root request
[ROOT PRIORITY] Port: 3000
✅ Sentia Manufacturing Dashboard started
```

### In Browser:
- Your React app with Clerk login
- NO "Railway Deployment Working!" message
- NO port 5000 references

## If Still Not Working:

### Nuclear Option - Recreate Service:
1. Note down all environment variables
2. Delete the service
3. Create new web service
4. Connect to same GitHub repo, development branch
5. Set all environment variables
6. Deploy

## Verification URL:
Once deployed, check:
- https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/ (should show React app)
- https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/health (should return JSON)

**The old "Railway" message is cached - clearing cache is essential!**
