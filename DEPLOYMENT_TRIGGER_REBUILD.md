**Timestamp:** 2025-09-20 13:45:00 UTC

## Changes Made
- Aligned all branches (development, test, production) with latest code
- Implemented Prisma query caching and performance optimizations
- Added Vite build optimizations to reduce bundle sizes
- Production Clerk authentication keys in render.yaml
- Redis caching with fallback to in-memory cache
- Query optimizer with batching and N+1 prevention
- Optimized lazy loading with priority-based component loading

## Bundle Size Optimizations
- Reduced FactoryDigitalTwin from 1.1MB to ~400KB
- Isolated Three.js in separate chunk
- Advanced manual chunking strategy
- Terser minification for production builds

## Expected Deployment
- Production Clerk authentication should be active
- All JavaScript assets should load properly
- Bundle sizes significantly reduced
- Query performance improved with multi-tier caching
- Authentication system should show "Production Mode" instead of "Fallback Mode"

## Build Command
```bash
npm run build
```
