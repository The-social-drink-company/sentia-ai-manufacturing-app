## üîç Root Cause Confirmed:

### Missing Clerk Authentication Environment Variables

The production server CANNOT start without these keys:

- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Navigate to sentia-manufacturing-production
3. Click Environment tab
4. Add the Clerk variables (see IMMEDIATE-ACTION-REQUIRED.md)
5. Save Changes
6. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

### Option 2: Emergency Bypass (Temporary)

If you cannot add Clerk variables immediately:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Add this single variable:
   ```
   BYPASS_AUTH=true
   ```
3. Save Changes
4. This will disable authentication temporarily
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This removes all security!
