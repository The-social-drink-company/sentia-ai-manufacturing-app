### Step 1: Commit and Push

```bash
git add render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix: Add all three environments to render.yaml for complete deployment"
git push origin development
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render

```bash
# Option A: Via Render Dashboard
# 1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
# 2. New â†’ Blueprint
# 3. Connect your GitHub repo

# Create production branch if not exists
git checkout -b production
git push origin production
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployments

```powershell
# Check all three environments
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-development.onrender.com/health
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-testing.onrender.com/health
curl https://sentia-manufacturing-production.onrender.com/health
