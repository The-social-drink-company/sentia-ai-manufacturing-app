```javascript
{
  development: 'https://daring-reflection-development.up.railway.app',
  testing: 'https://sentia-manufacturing-dashboard-testing.up.railway.app', 
  production: 'https://web-production-1f10.up.railway.app'
}
```

## üìä Circuit Breaker Pattern

The agent implements enterprise-grade circuit breaker protection:

### Circuit States
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **OPEN**: Failure threshold exceeded, requests are blocked
- **HALF-OPEN**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

### Failure Handling
```
Failure Count >= 5 ‚Üí Circuit OPEN ‚Üí Wait 60s ‚Üí HALF-OPEN ‚Üí Test ‚Üí CLOSED/OPEN
```

### Benefits
- Prevents cascade failures
- Automatic recovery testing
- Protects downstream services
- Provides failure metrics

## üéØ Auto-Recovery Strategies

### Intelligent Fix Selection
The agent selects recovery strategies based on error patterns:

#### Network/Timeout Issues
1. **Circuit Breaker Recovery**: Wait for automatic recovery
2. **Railway Service Restart**: Restart the failing service
3. **DNS and Cache Reset**: Clear network-related issues

#### HTTP 5xx Errors
1. **Server Recovery Wait**: Allow server self-recovery time
2. **Service Restart**: Force restart if wait timeout exceeded
3. **Escalation**: Alert for manual intervention

#### Authentication Failures
1. **Token Refresh**: Attempt to refresh authentication tokens
2. **Service Reconfiguration**: Reset authentication configuration
3. **Manual Alert**: Escalate for credential issues

### Recovery Success Tracking
- **Total Fixes**: Number of recovery attempts
- **Successful Fixes**: Number of successful recoveries
- **Fix Success Rate**: Percentage of successful recoveries
- **Recovery Time**: Average time to recover from failures

## üìà Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Score Calculation
The agent calculates an overall health score based on weighted factors:

```
Overall Score = (Mock Data √ó 40%) + (Security √ó 30%) + (Performance √ó 20%) + (Uptime √ó 10%)
```

### Score Interpretation
- **90-100**: Excellent - System operating optimally
- **80-89**: Good - System healthy with minor issues
- **70-79**: Acceptable - Some issues require attention
- **<70**: Failing - Immediate action required

### Automated Recommendations
The agent generates actionable recommendations based on test results:

#### Example Recommendations
```json
{
  "category": "Mock Data Elimination",
  "priority": "HIGH", 
  "recommendation": "Some endpoints are still returning mock data instead of requiring proper authentication. Review and fix authentication requirements."
}
```

## üìã Logs and Reports

### Log Locations

## üè≠ Production Deployment

### Recommended Setup
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables in Railway
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_production_token
AUTO_FIX_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_SCAN_ENABLED=true
PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true

# 2. Deploy agent as separate Railway service
railway link your-project-id
railway deploy

# 3. Schedule via cron or systemd (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
# Run every 10 minutes for production monitoring
```

### High-Availability Deployment
For enterprise environments, consider:
- Multiple agent instances across different regions
- Load balancer health checks integration
- Centralized logging and metrics collection
- Integration with existing monitoring systems (Datadog, New Relic)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Agent Security
- Agent runs with minimal required permissions
- No sensitive data stored in logs
- Secure token handling for external services
- HTTPS-only communications

### Validation Security
- Authentication error detection prevents data exposure
- Secret scanning prevents credential leaks
- Security header validation enforces best practices
- Input validation testing prevents injection attacks

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Won't Start
```bash
# Check Node.js version (requires v18+)
node --version

# Check dependencies
npm install

# Check log files
cat logs/self-healing/error.log
```

#### Circuit Breaker Always Open
```bash
# Check environment URLs are accessible
curl https://web-production-1f10.up.railway.app/api/health

# Increase failure threshold
export CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=10

# Check Railway service status
railway status
```

#### Mock Data Tests Failing
```bash
# Verify endpoints require authentication
curl https://web-production-1f10.up.railway.app/api/working-capital/metrics

# Expected: {"error": "Failed to calculate working capital metrics"}
# Not Expected: Actual data or hardcoded values
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run single test cycle
node scripts/enterprise-self-healing-agent.js --debug --single-run
```
